_Day 36 of the first 2020 Covid-19 Lockdown_

I'm a bit envious of the Covid-19 journals of my friends and colleagues [Chrissi Nerantzi](https://chrissinerantzi.wordpress.com/2020/04/28/week-5-diary-new-routines/) and [Sheila MacNeill](https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/81621783/posts/2678166571) so today I thought I'd try an experiment and post my Crispy Journal entry for [28th April 2020](https://journal.cpjobling.net/#28th%20April%202020) here in my blog. There was a bit of formatting to do to convert [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) markup to WordPress blocks which would go away if I used [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in both places. I think it might be better going forward to just link to the Journal page and post some highlights and a reflection. But, hey, what is a Covid-19 lockdown if it isn't a chance to experiment.
