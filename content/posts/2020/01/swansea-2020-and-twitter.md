On Monday I attended the launch and first public lecture of the Swansea University's centenary celebration [Swansea 2020](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/centenary2020/) and the launch of the [Centenary Essays](https://collections.swansea.ac.uk/s/swansea-2020/page/welcome) site.

At the lecture, Sam Blaxland, the historian appointed by the University to [write the history](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/centenary2020/history/) of the University's first 100 years, gave us an excellent overview of the highlights of that centenary and how he went about writing the book which will be released in June.

Twitter 1920?
-------------

On Wednesday, in the lead up to the LTHChat ([wakelet](https://twitter.com/LTHEchat/status/1220284728265396225)), my Twitter colleague Simon Rae asked me how I thought the original academics who welcomed the first 80 odd students to enrol in 1920 might have viewed Twitter:

To which I replied:

This led to this interesting conversation between Simon and Sam (tweeting as @[Swansea2020](httos://twitter.com/Swansea2020)) which I include in full:

Oral History and Podcasting
---------------------------

Sam's approach to writing his history included the use of oral history and he has interviewed hundreds of people over the three-year project. He has adapted these skills further by hosting the University's [Exploring Global Problems Podcast](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/research/podcasts/) an excellent series that is worth a listen!
