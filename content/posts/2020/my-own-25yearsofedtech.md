Yesterday, I received my copy of Martin Weller's book [25 Years of Ed Tech](https://www.aupress.ca/books/120290-25-years-of-ed-tech/). Inspired by [Chapter 2 The Web (1995)](https://read.aupress.ca/read/a6922eef-ff01-4b2a-86fe-f45b1185440a/section/021e8a8b-448a-4df7-b617-180c9bd5aef9#ch02), I travelled back in time to my own first attempt to teach online. I visited the **Way Back Machine** ([web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org)) to discover that the first official University website (www.swan.ac.uk) was archived on [11th December 1997](https://web.archive.org/web/19971211193148/http://www.swan.ac.uk/).

Navigating through that web site, I discovered that the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering website (which I built) was archived a few months earlier. I also rediscovered that I had published a potted history of the [Electronic and Electrical Engineering web site](https://blog.cpjobling.net/uncategorised/history-of-electrical-engineering-on-the-web/) on this blog.

In the spirit of celebrating my own 35-year career in teaching, I looked back at my own first attempt at e-learning. And here is my web site for [EE208: Control Systems](https://web.archive.org/web/19970511101123/http://faith.swan.ac.uk/Courses/level2/ee208/ee208.html), circa May 1997.

EE208: Control Systems, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Swansea University, May 1997. Captured from the Internet Archive's Way Back Machine on 7th November 2020.

The course notes were created using [LaTex2HTML](https://www.latex2html.org/), but unfortunately, the images and the mathematics, which was presented using images, have rotted in the archive. Today I use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for my lecture notes, and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for math generation, but the technology that delivers my content to students still web-based.

So for me, like most ed-tech folks, the key technology in my teaching career has been the World Wide Web. The difference now, for most of us, is that we don't need to know that!
