Shall we Zoom by [Chris Jobling](https://blog.cpjobling.net) 19 May 2020 [CC BY ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/)

Inspired by [Brian Mathers](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/2555664552200391948) here's a little sketch I made about my daily reality. I seem to spend my entire day on (or is it in?) Zoom -- meetings, working groups, office hours , examples classes and even social events. Meanwhile my grey beard grows and I turn into a caricature of a mad professor.

What's you day-to-day like?

This was the rest of my day [Journal, 19th May](https://journal.cpjobling.net/#19th%20May%202020) [2020](https://journal.cpjobling.net/#19th%20May%202020).
