Yesterday was the [12th Annual conference of the Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching (SALT)](https://spark.adobe.com/page/4RSL8HutbLEGi/) which, due to circumstances, had to be held on line. I attended but didn't present but as usual I came away with a head full of ideas and links to follow up on.

The highlights for me were the session on formative feedback by Monika Seisenberger and Teaching Award winner Liam O'Brien from Computer Science; the Coffee Lounge where I met up with folks for the first time since March; the talk on aligning our Canvas tools to the future of assessment with Instructure's Jonathan Perry (beamed live from Britains most boring town and Birthplace of Margaret Thatcher Grantham, Lincs.) ; and the panel on the values and assumptions of assessment and feedback chaired by Swansea University's Dean of Assessment Jo Berry.

My unordered notes, thoughts and links shared by the participants are recorded in my [Journal](https://journal.cpjobling.net/journal.cpjobling.net/#SALT%20Conference%202020).
