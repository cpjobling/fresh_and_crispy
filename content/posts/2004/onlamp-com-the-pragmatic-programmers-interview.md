O’Reilly Network interviews the Pragmatic Programmers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in [OnLamp](OnLamp.com). Many nuggets including this one:

> Ward Cunningham once told me “With better IDEs, static languages such as Java are almost as easy to program in as dynamic languages.” You’re both fans of the Ruby language, especially when compared to more static languages. Do you think that the potential shift to writing business applications in slightly more dynamic languages such as Java and C# \[…\] is good for programmer productivity and ease, or do those languages not go far enough?

Memory management is a small part of the picture, but the real gains in these more dynamic languages come from different areas, particularly from a flexible type model and from the ability to metaprogram. Ultimately, it comes down to ease of expression. If I can express myself in code at a level closer to the problem domain, then I’m going to be more effective, and my code is likely to be easier to maintain and extend…I know some companies are using \[problem domain code\] with great success. And you know — they’re keeping quiet about it.
