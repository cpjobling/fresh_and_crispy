Martin Fowler mentioned [UMLet](http://qse.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~auer/umlet/index.html) in his recent article on [UmlSketchingTools](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlSketchingTools.html) which [I blogged about](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2004/06/umlsketchingtools.html) earlier this week. A paper in which the authors (Auer _et al_, 2003) describe the ideas behind UMLet is very insightful and pretty much echoes my own experiences of over-blown UML tools in the teaching domain (and I’ve tried ArgoUML, Poseidon CE, Together and Rational Rose with variable — but mostly limited — success over the last three or four years).

I have to say that, although it currently only supports class, object and use-case diagrams, UMLet looks very promising and may well prove to be a winner in next year’s Software Engineering courses. Better yet, UMLet can be used as an Eclipse plugin!
