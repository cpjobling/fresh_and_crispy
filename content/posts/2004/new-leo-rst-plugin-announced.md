I have today announced the availability of a revised RST plugin that does most of the proposed functionality discussed [here](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1106314&forum_id=10228) and announced in this Blog last [Thursday](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2004/07/proposal-for-merged-rst-plugin.html). This is my first chance to give something nack to the open source community! It’s purely selfish of course! I need this functionality and I’ve just scratched my own itch!
