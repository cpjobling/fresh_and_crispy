A long held artical of faith in the Java world is that Java is a Single Language solution. It’s the biggest differentiator between .NET and Java, for example. A summit was held at Sun HQ (reported by Tim Bray) \[thanks to dion on TECH for the link\] in which it is clear that Sun is interested in other languages that could run on the JVM. The obvious ones are Jython and Groovy, but present was Larry Wall (of Perl fame) and Guido van Rossum (of Python). An interesting topic to watch, particularly as dynamic languages features in my Software Applications course. I’ve added Tim Bray’s web log to my Blogger account.
