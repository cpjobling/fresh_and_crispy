My colleague Tim Davies and I assessed the web sites that form a key part of the UWS Micromouse project that is part of [EG-252 Group Design Project](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=EGSC&mod=EG-252&ayr=03/04&psl=TB1%2B2&detailOnly=). Some really good sites but my favourites were [Group B](http://ee133.swan.ac.uk/bteam/) which scored highest for style and [Group E](http://ee133.swan.ac.uk/ez/) which scored highest for content and UML designs. Some bad apples too: [Group D](http://ee133.swan.ac.uk:8090/dangermouse/Micromouse/) doesn’t have a site and [Group F](http://ee133.swan.ac.uk/bob/) doesn’t have much content!
