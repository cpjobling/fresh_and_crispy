I am grateful to the author of the “You are number 6″ blog for [pointing out](http://youarenumber6.blogspot.com/2004/08/got-question-about-java-fred-or-eric.html) two great sources of information on _All Things Java Related_. In future I’ll be asking [Fred](http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/) and [Eric](http://www.pconline.com/~erc/javalinux.htm) about a lot of things! Definately a couple of links for my course pages.
