I’m currently reading the [free beta chapter](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/chapter/index.html) of [Version Control with Subversion](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/index.html) from the forthcoming O’Reilly [open book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/). Given that subversion can apparently use simple web technology, it may have more potential for use in a teaching situation than CVS — provided that the plugins for ant and eclipse are as good as the CVS ones! Watch this log for experiences on CVS versus Subversion.
