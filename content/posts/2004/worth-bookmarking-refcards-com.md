Refcards.com is a site where you can get handy reference cards for numerous open source tools and technologies. They can be printed double sided onto card (or paper) and fold into a three-column, easy-to-carry quick reference. Brilliant! The site had apparently disappeared for a while but is now back. Its author Andrew Ford has produced a new refcard for Template Toolkit. He has included some cards on Web technologies (very useful as handouts for my students!) from Benjamin Jung. Thanks to [Chris Winters](http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=3191) for the heads up.
