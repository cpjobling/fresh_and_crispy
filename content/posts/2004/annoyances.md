Today was an open day at UWS. Every department and school was expected to lay something on for potential students. Every admissions tutor (who usually gets lumbered with this sort of thing) is expected to take time off to be pleasant and show the little kiddies around. Except that all the labs that I would have shown were locked because no one had told the technicians that they should be opened! I’m afraid that I blew a gasket and got out of there. So if there was a tour of EEE and ICCT facilities, I didn’t give it. I feel quite guilty about letting folks down … but I’m also angry that here’s yet another example to support my growing perception of the decline of Electrical Engineering at Swansea and my need to get out of here!

Furthermore, the Exchange web server is down so I can’t read my email from home. Given that my connection to exchange via Outlook at work is also next to useless, I’m incommunicado for a while!
