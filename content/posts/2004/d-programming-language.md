Mentioned by Bruce Eckel in his recent Talk blogged earlier, D is another programming language in the C/C++/C#/Java stable. This [Language Comparison Table](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/comparison.html) is a good place to start as is this [Paper and Presentation](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/sdwest/index.html). Another Blogger (Kurt Zhou) also [also picked up on this](http://jroller.com/page/kurt/20040714#d_language).
