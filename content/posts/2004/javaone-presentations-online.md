Thanks to [dIon Gillard](http://www.multitask.com.au/people/dion/archives/000234.html) for this [link](http://javaoneonline.mentorware.net/servlet/mware.servlets.LoginServlet?subsysId=2000). Having nothing much better to do today I watched [J2EE Best Practices using a Real-Life Example](http://javaoneonline.mentorware.net/servlet/mware.servlets.StudentServlet?mwaction=generic&file=webinar2_abstract&subsysId=2000) a webinar by Carol McDonald. A good seminar showing how to use the Core J2EE Patterns to best affect. Comments on layering, the presentation, business and persistence layers all very good. But like Rod Johnson and Bruce Tate are telling us, a lot of these patterns are actually _anti patterns_ whose purpose is to overcome architectural deficiencies in the J2EE architecture rather than _best_ practice. Still useful material for my revised EG-M42 lectures in November and Iâ€™ll be adopting some of the explanations and diagrams I think.
