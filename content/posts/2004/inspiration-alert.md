Jon Udell has just published an inspirational column in his “Prime Time Hypermedia” series on O’Relly.net. Called [Software Movies](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html), Jon shows how you can make much more immediate, high-impact, demos using video capture than is possible with text and images. He demonstrates this with a great [example](http://udell.roninhouse.com/movies/democapture.wmv) of how he used [Windows Media Encoder](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx) (WME … a _free_ download from MicroSoft) to capture a [video demo of using xpath to make queries on his blog](http://udell.roninhouse.com/movies/captured.wmv). (The video of WME was itself created using a commercial screen video capture system called [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/) (from the same people who make SnagIt). I’ve downloaded WME myself and an feeling inspired to do something similar for my courses, and will do, as soon as I have a decent microphone!
