Over the next day or so I plan to work my way though Thomas Risberg’s tutorial _[Developing a Spring Framework MVC Application Step-by-Step](http://www.springframework.org/docs/MVC-step-by-step/Spring-MVC-step-by-step.html)_. Read in conjunction with Rod Johnson’s [new book](http://www.springframework.org/books.html), which I skimmed this morning, I should be up to speed with Spring in time to decide if it will work with my module _EG-M42: Client-Server Programming with Java_. If all goes well, I plan to have a look at [Spring IDE for Eclipse](http://www.springframework.org/spring-ide/eclipse/) and [Spring Live](http://www.sourcebeat.com/TitleAction.do?id=7) before starting my own case-study project which will either be a reimplementation of the\* World of Zuul\* from [Objects First with Java](http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/) or George Reese’s bank account example from [Database Programming with JDBC and Java](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jdbc2/index.html).
