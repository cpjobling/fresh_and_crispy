Committed myself to contributing to Headstart and EESW (two summer schools that we run in the [School of Engineering](http://www.engineering.swan.ac.uk)) … again! Subject of my bit this year will be Blogging (or more formally _Using the Internet as a Research and Collaboration Tool_. The idea is that I’ll give the students a potted introduction to the Internet, www, semantic web, rss, blogging etc and then get them to create group blogs focussed on high-performance ballooning (our Summer School topic). The beauty is that Blogger’s new features (including email submission of articles) provide a great way for the students to keep in touch with each other (and [UWS](http://www.swan.ac.uk) of course) when they all disperse to their homes.

Also, as a side issue, I’m hoping that it’ll do a little bit to promote Blogging as a useful school activity.
