Second article in new IBM developerWorks series [alt.lang.jre](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/articles.jsp?sort_order=desc&expand=&sort_by=Date&show_abstract=true&view_by=Search&search_by=alt.lang.jre) is an introduction to the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) language by Andrew Glover entitled [Feeling Groovy](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-alj08034.html). The first article in the series is [Get to Know Jython](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-alj07064/) by Barry A. Feigenbaum and is also worth a read.

Groovy has a possible advantage over [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) in that it has become the subject of a Java Community Process (JCP) project ([JSR 241](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241)) and so may become a "_standard_" for scripting Java objects. It is more Java-_flavoured_ than Jython yet provides some familiar features. It might be worth considering for EG-358 because it could be introduced without needing the context shift that J/Python requires.
