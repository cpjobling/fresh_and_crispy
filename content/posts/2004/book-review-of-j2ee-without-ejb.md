First [review](http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=J2EEWithoutEJB_BookReview) of Rod Johnson’s new book J2EE Development without EJB by Dion Almaer on the ServerSide. As I’ve just had email from Amazon.co.uk that my copy was dispatched last week, I’ll reserve judgment for now. However, I’m hoping for some useful insights that will help in the redevelopment of my “Client Server Programming in Java” course. Pity it arrives too late to go into the booklist!
