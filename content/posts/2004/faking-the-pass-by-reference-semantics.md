Nice blog article about Java’s [pass-by-reference semantics](http://radio.javaranch.com/channel/val/2004/05/21/1085125887000.html). I still think Kathy Sierra’s Campfire Story [Pass-by-Value Please](http://www.javaranch.com/campfire/StoryPassBy.jsp) is a good an explanation of this difficult concept as you’ll find. And it’s nice and memorable. Kathy and Bert Bates make good use of the analogy in [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004656/qid=1085140914/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2_2/202-6150277-0851808) too.
