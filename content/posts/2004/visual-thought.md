Jeremy Rayner’s [June 15 blog entry](http://web1.2020media.com/j/jez/javanicuscom/blog2/items/135-index.html) directed me to another free drawing tool for UML diagrams. Thanks for the link!

<

p>I mentioned [violet](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2004/06/violet-uml-tool.html) a couple of days ago. It is really simple, unfortunately it doesn’t have the ability to move classes around once positioned. This makes it a a bit hard to use. It is open source so that could be fixed of course!

<

p>Visual Thought is a drawing tool so it has the same advantages as Visio in that it’s not designed for [MDA](http://www.omg.org/mda/) or for code generation, so you can happily use it for [agile modelling](http://www.agilemodeling.com/). As I have some modelling to do over the summer as I rewrite my _Client-Server Programming in Java Module_, I’ll let you know how it goes!
