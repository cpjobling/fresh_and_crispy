Rod Johnson talks about lightweight containers, IoC (dependency injection), Spring, AOP, EJB and Java 1.5. The interview was recorded at this year’s TSS symposium. I’ve just gotten Rod’s new book (see also the [review](http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=J2EEWithoutEJB_BookReview) blogged yesterday) and this interview has gotten me all excited to dive in.
