Not quite on topic, but well worth considering:

> “If I were sitting down to design a course today, I’d put at the top of my paper: What can I do to make them curious and interested? What can I do to get them to where they can be creative? And finally, What can I do to help them feel like THEY kick ass, as opposed to thinking that _I_ kick ass? (too many teachers try to impress the students with how smart the teacher is, but IMHO it’s way better for everyone if the students leave your class impressed with how smart THEY are).”
