I need to develop a web application to allow student upload of Java programs for testing. A Jython servlet with some form of template engine for presentation may be part of the solution (full framework J2EE application seems overkill!). I came across several interesting articles after a simple Google search for [Velocity and Jython](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=velocity+jython). This one is definitely worth another look later: [Pythlet](http://stefano.campanini.info/docs/Pythlet/Pythlet-using-jython.html).
