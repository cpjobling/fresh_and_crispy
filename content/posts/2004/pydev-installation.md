I am following Ron Smith’s 15 June 2004 article [Python development with Eclipse and Ant](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecant/index.html?ca=drs-tp2604) from IBM developerWorks. The first step is to install the [PyDev](http://pydev.sf.net) plugin which is available at Eclipse update site [http://pydef.sf.net/updates/](http://pydef.sf.net/updates/).

First problem is that when I try to call the python interpreter to run the test I get a launch error. Don’t know if this is an Eclipse, PyDev or Python problem. Launch configuration seems ok! I checked the pydev user forum and this is a [known problem](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1100024&forum_id=293649) and we await a fix.
