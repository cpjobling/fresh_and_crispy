John Udell points to two great little nuggets from an [Channel9](channel9.msdn.com) interview of Ward Cunningham, inventor of the [Wikki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). Ward talks about the difficulties of programming in the modern context and how the Wikki came to be. Nice to see what Ward looks like too.
