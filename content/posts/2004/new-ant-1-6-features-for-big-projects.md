A new tutorial article by _Stefan Bodewig_ on the [OracleTM Technology Network](http://otn.oracle.com/) has been brought to my attention by a news article on [TSS](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26797) (thanks Sudhakar Ramakrishan). Describes the new , and tasks that should make ant even better! Will print and read the detail later, but I canâ€™t wait to try some of these out on the EG-140 build (which needs all kinds of scripting tricks to work).
