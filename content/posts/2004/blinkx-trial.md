After an interest piquing article in yesterday’s Guardian Online [All Eyes on Blinkx](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1260983,00.html), I downloaded a beta copy of the [Blinkx](http://www.blinkx.com/) client. It’s currently 67% through indexing _My Documents_ at the moment. Key features:

*   It uses AI techniques to index the content of document rather than Google’s page ranking algorithm.
*   It indexes documents and email inboxes on your own computer.
*   It has smart searches
*   It can produce a sort of concept map of the results of your search.
*   It scours USENET and Blogs as well as static web pages.

The home page claims to have indexed 10% of the Internet.

Interesting technology!
