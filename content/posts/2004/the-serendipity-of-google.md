I just did a google search for [“collaborative programming” + wikki](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22collaborative+programming%22+wikki) on google and came up with (the only match!) [Pair Programming: More Learning and Less Anxiety in a First Programming Course](http://gemasterteachers.neu.edu/resources/pairprog03.pdf). Not exactly what I expected to find, but very relevant nonetheless. Perhaps even better, the paper is hosted at [The GE Master Teachers for Freshman Engineering at Northeastern University](http://gemasterteachers.neu.edu/) which seems to be a clearing house for best practice. A partcular gem is _[Chalk Talk with Jonas Chalk](http://gemasterteachers.neu.edu/chalktalk.htm)_ which is a essentially a L&T Best Practices FAQ written in the form of an Agony Aunt Column.
