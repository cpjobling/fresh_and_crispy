Came across this survey of [Screen Presentation Tools](http://www.miwie.org/presentations/index.html) by Michael Wiedmann whilest looking for ways to do lecture slides/notes in LaTeX. I was directed to that page by blog entry [LaTeX beamer](http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2004/06/13/latex-beamer/) on the [_but she’s a girl…_](http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog) blog by way of a Google Search for [LaTeX beamer](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=latex+beamer). This was after finding a reference to the [LaTeX beamer](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net) package (a similar package to [Prosper](http://prosper.sourceforge.net)) in [New Beamer](http://semantics-online.org/geek/2003/11/new_beamer) from Kai von Fietel’s [_Geek Notes2_](http://semantics-online.org/geek/). I found Kai’s quote by Googling [LaTeX+slides+handouts+notes](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=LaTeX+slides+handouts+notes).

Another result of the [LaTeX beamer](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=latex+beamer) search was the google directory page [Computers>Software>Typesetting>TeX>LaTeX>Macros>](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Typesetting/TeX/LaTeX/Macros/) which has links to other useful tools.
