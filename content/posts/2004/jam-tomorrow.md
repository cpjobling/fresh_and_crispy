Something to look into:

> "JAM leverages the new import and target override features of Ant 1.6 to create a reusable, consistent Java build framework. JAM modules support JBoss, XDoclet, JUnit, Cactus, Struts, Castor, Resin and MDA/UML code generation. Mavenâ€™s POM and repository features are supported via a Maven-to-Ant bridge."
