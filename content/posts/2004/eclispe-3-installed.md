I have just downloaded and installed Eclipse 3.0. For safetyâ€™s sake I backed up my old workspace and deleted the `.metadata` folder. I also unzipped Eclipse into a clean directory. On startup, Eclipse now asks for a default workspace. This feature should make installation much easier on the School network, cause we can leave it to the students.
