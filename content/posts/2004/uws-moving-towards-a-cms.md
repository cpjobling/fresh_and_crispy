At at meeting of the web strategy group various options of CMS were discussed. University is pursuing a tender from each of the following:

*   [RedDot](http://www.reddot.co.uk/)
    
*   [Percussion](http://www.percussion.com/)
    
*   [TerminalFour](http://www.terminalfour.com/)
    

Also mentioned wais an open source alternative [OpenCMS](http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/) which runs in a Tomcat+MySQL context. We hope to have a demo of the OpenCMS system in LIS later this week.

In related news I installed Tomcat on eehope (my new SuSE 9.1 Server). Installation was via YaST and very smooth. It took some time to discover the right settings for the server (see [Webserver Log Entry for Today](http://eespectre.blogspot.com/#108973565153642707)) but now have a running demoserver at [http://eehope.swan.ac.uk:8080](http://eehope.swan.ac.uk:8080).
