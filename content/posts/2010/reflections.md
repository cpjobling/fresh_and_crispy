My University has invested in a license for [Learning Objects Campus Pack 4](http://learningobjects.com/campuspackfusion.jsp) and I’ve created a new blog in my new [Personal Learning Space](http://learningobjects.com/personal.jsp). I’m calling it _[Reflections](http://swan-ac-uk.campuspack.eu/Users/Chris.Jobling/Reflections)_ for now and I’ll be using it to record ideas and thoughts on my personal learning and teaching experiences. I’ve changed the permissions to make the blog public with open comments. I can always change this later if it turns out to be a bad idea.
