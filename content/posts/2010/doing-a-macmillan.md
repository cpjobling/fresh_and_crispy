It’s a [repost](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/08/walking-for-macmillan.html), but I thought I’d remind my faithful readers that I’ll be taking part in the [Gower Macmarathon](http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Fundraising/Inyourarea/Wales/South_East_Wales/Local_events/GowerMacmarathon2010.aspx) in a week’s time. Renate and I have been doing some training in West Yorkshire (where coincidentally there where a number of excellent real-ale pubs) and both expect to be fit enough. The Gower Macmarathon is a sponsored 22 mile walk from Rhossilli to Mumbles in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. You’ll find my Just Giving widget to the right of this post and it’d be great if we could get to our modest target of £200. If you are reading this by email or RSS feed, the direct URL is: [http://www.justgiving.com/Chris-Jobling](http://www.justgiving.com/Chris-Jobling). Thanks to those supporters who have already contributed!

Hopefully, I’ll be tweeting on-route so you can follow our progress on the day! I hope to have a blog posting after the event!
