[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/f1e52-youtube-new.png?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/f1e52-youtube-new.png) Visited YouTube today to rate [Stephen Fry’s “unboxing my iPad” video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIic04tXkRw) (thanks to [Digital Inspiration](http://www.labnol.org/gadgets/ipad-unboxing-video/13332/) for the link) and noticed that YouTube has changed its user interface. If you visit the site,  
“Take the Quick Tour” (highlighted middle right) will show you what’s new. _First impressions_: It’s certainly much less cluttered. _Do I like it_? Time will tell.
