I participated in my first [#lrnchat](http://tweetchat.com/room/lrnchat) session on Twitter this afternoon. I found it difficult to cope with the volume of information coming in – hence the allusion to fire hoses in the title. While I was composing my next 140 characters of wit and wisdom, 27 messages would scroll by! But I did discover [Tweetchat](http://tweetchat.com/).

There were some stand out moments such as the comparison of Google Wave ([topical on the day](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/08/wave-bye-bye.html)) with [Pet Rocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock)1 and the comic reflection on the Twitter chat experience: “I once was lost, but now, profound.” Both gems came from [@Dave\_Ferguson](http://twitter.com/Dave_Ferguson) as it happens.

The nice people of [lrnchat.com](http://lrnchat.com/) have already [posted the transcript](http://lrnchat.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/04082010early/), so at least there’s a record and proof that I didn’t just lurk. Thanks to [@c4lpt](http://twitter.com/c4lpt) for the initial invitation and the encouragement. I’ll try to be back!

BTW does LOL mean what I think it means?

1 As a European, a British European at that, the allusion to Pet Rocks went over my head. Thank goodness for Wikipedia.
