I’ve been a long-time admirer of the \[Head First\](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/index.php) series of books since the dim and distant days of \[Head First EJB\](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596005719/). I have quite a collection of these books myself and often recommend them to students who want to do some self-directed learning, say to learn \[Java\](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009205/) or \[HTML and CSS\](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101978/).

Every book starts by explaining the pedagogical principles (developed by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates) behind the books and these principles are \[enumerated\](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/readme.php) on the Head First labs site.

My question is can these principles be adapted to a lecture course?

I’m going to spend some of the remainder of this summer evaluating a couple of the newer books for one of my modules and I’ll be trying to keep these principles in mind as I do so.

So what does it take to \*learn\* something? First, you have to \*get\* it, then make sure you don’t \*forget\* it. It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, \*learning\* takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.
