The O’Reilly Open Source Convention ([OSCON 2010](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010)) took place last week in Portland Oregon. Videos of the talks are being published on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=12696FB0B040FA53) and [Blip.TV](http://oscon.blip.tv/posts?view=archive&nsfw=dc). Taken with the convention site, the various related blog postings and twitter feed, there’s lots of useful information.

What stood out for me in the video feed was Daniel Recordon’s talk “[Today’s Lamp Stack](http://blip.tv/file/3917866)” which describes how Facebook’s has been implemented on the [LAMP stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29). It’s a talk that will be useful as a learning resource for my course on Web Applications Technology.

For ease of access, I include the embeddable version here.

The learning message is that there’s a lot more to hosting a big site like Facebook than Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP!
