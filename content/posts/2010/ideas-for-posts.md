[![Apart from one or two errors, the translation of my scrawl on the left to the text on the right is pretty good!](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4910b-2010-09-09_1349.png?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4910b-2010-09-09_1349.png)The 17th annual conference of the Association for Learning Technology [ALT-C 2010](http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2010/) has just ended. And though I did not attend, I was fairly fully engaged with the keynote and invited sessions that were streamed via [CrowdVine](http://altc2010.alt.ac.uk/pages/online_participation) in [Elluminate](http://www.elluminate.com/) and will be made available on the [ALT-C channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ClipsFromALT) on YouTube.

Reflection starts now and I thought that I would use my newest e-learning gadget, my \[LiveScribe Echo\](http://www.livescribe.com/uk/) pen, and trial copy of \[MyScript for LiveScribe\](http://www.visionobjects.com/en/webstore/myscript-for-livescribe/description/) to jot down and post some ideas for possible topics for this or the \[Swansea Learning Lab Community\](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/) blog.

Here is the list of possible blogging topics (mostly questions rather than answers note):

\- How to engage with Twitter. - Why don’t academics use technology? - Is the lecture dead? - What can we learn from the hole in the wall? - Should students be telling us what to do? - Carrot and sticks: could we change academics attitudes to effective ICT \[for learning\]? - Remote attendance at conferences – could it be better than being there? \- Using LiveScribe or similar in lectures (as a lecturer rather than as a student).

Hopefully, this page will serve as a reminder to think about and write some of these up over the coming academic year.

The discussion will no doubt continue for a few days yet in the Twitterverse (tag \[#altc2010\](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23altc2010)), on \[Cloud Works\](http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1987), and in \[Facebook\](http://www.facebook.com/#!/ALTC2010).
