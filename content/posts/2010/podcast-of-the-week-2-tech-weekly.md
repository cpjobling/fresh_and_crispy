It’s actually a fortnight since the last one but … this week’s _Podcast of the Week_ is The Guardian’s excellent [Tech Weekly](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/techweekly) podcast. Every Wednesday, regular host [Aleks Krotoski](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alekskrotoski) along with regular contributors Guardian Technology Editor [Charles Arthur](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur) and Digital Media Reporter [Jemima Kiss](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jemimakiss), discuss the big technology news items of the week.

Since the demise of The Guardian’s Thursday Technology supplement, the podcast is the quickest way to keep up to date. \[Highlights this week\](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/audio/2010/aug/03/mobile-phones-future-android-ios) include a discussion of emerging trends in the Mobile Internet, the new Amazon Kindle and the ban on Blackberrys in the UAE.

Academic colleagues may be interested to learn that \[Mendeley\](http://www.mendeley.com/) will be discussed next week.

The Guardian Online has excellent technology coverage online. The launch point for exploration is \[www.guardian.co.uk/technology\](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology). If you’re on the move, The Guardian’s mobile offering (\[m.guardian.co.uk\](http://m.guardian.co.uk/)) is not bad either!
