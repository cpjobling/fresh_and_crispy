[Week 7 of PLENK2010](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+7) is all about the tools. I subject about which I believe I actually have some expertise.

> Though the concept of the personal learning environment has been around for the last five years, there has not been a comprehensive summation of what has been developed in the field. We would like to build that summation this week.

Now what tools do we use to build a summation? Is this a job for the wiki which has thus far been sadly underused? Or will we mind map? Google doc?
