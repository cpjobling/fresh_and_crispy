[Philip Larkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin) was the Librarian at the University of Hull and while I was a student there, I think I actually saw him once, striding imperiously through the Brynmor Jones Library. He was also a famous poet who died in 1985 and the City of Hull is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his death with a number of [special events](http://www.larkin25.co.uk/index.php).

One of the more bizarre events is [Larkin with Toads](http://www.larkin25.co.uk/larkin-with-toads.php), the temporary invasion of 40 giant fibre-glass toads, a public art installation which celebrates Larkin’s poems of working life ‘Toads’ and ‘Toads Revisited’ (See [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkin_with_Toads)).

During the August Bank Holiday weekend, my wife and I took two days to wander around Hull to to try and see and photograph as many of the toads as we could. Usefully you can get a map for this from the City Tourist Information Office and [online](http://www.larkin25.co.uk/location-map.php).

We also took the opportunity to try some real ale in [Ye Olde White Hart](http://www.yeoldewhiteharte.co.uk/), [The Old English Gentleman](http://www.viewhull.co.uk/pubsandbars/old-english-gentleman-review-53084.html), The [Minerva Hotel](http://www.eyorks.com/hullpub/minerva.html) and [Ye Olde Black Boy](http://www.pub-explorer.com/eyorks/pub/yeoldeblackboyhull.htm).

I’ve put my photos on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157624817621269) and here is a Slideshow of the toads. You can also view the toads on [a map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157624817621269/map/). If you want to see them for yourself, you’ll have to hurry, the installation ends at the end of September.
