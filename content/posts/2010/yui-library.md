This last week or so I’ve been watching a lot of Yahoo! [YUI Theatre](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/) videos on JavaScript, starting with Douglas Crockford’s excellent five-part series [Crockford on JavaScript](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/) and ending yesterday with Christian Heillman’s inspiring talk on [YQL and YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=heilmann-yql). This has inspired me to explore how I can use [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) (a JavaScript library) in the next version of my _Proman_ dissertation project management application which will be needed for 2010-2011 allocation round in May. If it works out, there’ll also be some new teaching material for next year’s Web Applications module (EG-259).

I’ll post more in the under the tag YUI on the \[Proman, Man\](http://promanman.blogspot.com/search/label/yui) blog as I get to grips with this stuff.
