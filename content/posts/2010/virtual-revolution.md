A new BBC/Open University documentary series on the World Wide Web started last Friday on BBC 2. It is called “The Virtual Revolution” and is hosted by [Guardian Technology](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology) journalist Dr Aleks Krotoski.

It is interesting not so much for its technical depth (which quite frankly is quite shallow) but for its introduction to the social/political/commercial issues surrounding the Internet and the World Wide Web. Plus it has interviews with many of the pioneers and entrepreneurs who were involved in its development.

The series is available to watch again on the BBC iPlayer and there is a supporting web site ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/)) that has lots of further information.

I am urging all my ICCT students to watch it!
