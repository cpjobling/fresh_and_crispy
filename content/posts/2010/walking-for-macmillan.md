In four week’s time, on the 11th September, Renate and I will be taking part in the [Gower Macmarathon Walk](http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Fundraising/Inyourarea/Wales/South_East_Wales/Local_events/GowerMacmarathon2010.aspx) from Rhossili to Mumbles. A distance of 22 miles. We’ve [set up a page](http://www.justgiving.com/Chris-Jobling) to help collect sponsorship (see widget to right) and hopefully some of my readers, followers, friends and colleagues will be able to contribute.

I’ll be posting more news here and on the JustGiving sponsorship page as I get into training for this event. And I’ll be posting regular updates on twitter and my Facebook page.

Hopefully, 3G coverage and data caps permitting, I’ll be live twitpicing and twitvideoing on the day.
