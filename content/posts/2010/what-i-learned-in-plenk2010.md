Short answer … not much. At least that’s how it appears to me at the moment.

I do know that I’m all PLENKED out, somewhat depressed and not looking forward to immersing myself in #jiscel10.

Perhaps it’s a symptom of [SAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder), or maybe I’m just in mourning.
