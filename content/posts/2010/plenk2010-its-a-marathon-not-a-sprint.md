The faciltators said we couldn’t possibly read everything, but I feel like I’ve not read _anything_ from Weeks 4 and 5. As you can see there’s a huge amount of discussion going on in the [Week 4 forum](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?f=16) and it’s already building up in [Week 5](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?f=17) which has just started. And that’s not even counting the twitter feed and _The Daily_. I feel like a marathon runner who went too fast for the first 3rd and is not going to make the 13 mile marker.

Part of the problem is the encroachment of my real job … but still, I need some encouragement here.
