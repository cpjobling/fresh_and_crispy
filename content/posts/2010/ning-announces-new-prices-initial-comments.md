Yesterday I received an email from Ning’s CEO Jason Rosenthal announcing the “[exciting new developments in Ning](http://blog.ning.com/2010/05/introducing-ning-pro-ning-plus-and-ning-mini.html)” (which include the phasing out of free Ning) which will be rolled out in July. The mid-range price plan Ning-plus at $19.95 per month works out cheaper than the current offerings. The equivalent of the current Free Ning (Ning mini) will now cost $2.95 per month, is limited to 150 members and no groups, but will allow you to have no or your own advertising. There will be a free-to-educators-Ning but that is limited to K-12 (primary and secondary school) usage and will be supported by sponsorship from an unnamed educational software supplier.

Some migration tools are promised for those network creators who, like me I guess, will not or cannot pay to continue to run a network once the 30 days from July deadline arrives. For initial comments, Steve Hargadon of Classroom 2.0 has a well [reasoned response to the announcement from the educational network user’s perspective](http://www.stevehargadon.com/2010/05/new-ning-plans-good-bad-and-unknown.html) and ReadWriteWeb (thanks Helen!) has also posted a comment on the [free-for-education proposal](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ning_announces_new_pricing_model_free_nings_for_te.php). I am sure there are more reactions; I haven’t had much time this week to dip into the news stream, but do keep me posted via the comments!
