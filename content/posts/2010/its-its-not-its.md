Just posted my [last post](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/04/new-look-youtube.html) and I noticed that I’d typed it’s when I meant its. This is a common error that I pick up my students on all the time, but it’s one that I make myself quite frequently.

\[Its\](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/its) is the possessive adjective form of the pronoun \*it\* used in the post in question as “YouTube has changed \*\*its\*\* user interface”. \[It’s\](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it's) is a contraction of \*it is\* as used in “\*First impressions\*: \*\*it’s\*\* \[that is YouTube’s new interface \*is\*\] certainly much less cluttered”.

Student beware: this type of error won’t be picked up with a spell checker … it might be picked up by a grammar checker … but don’t count on it. Since \*its\* is actually quite rare, as things don’t usually possess other things, it’s probably \*it’s\* that you want. But if you are unsure, ask yourself “is it its or is or is it it is?”
