I’ve just finished reading Martin Weller’s paper [The Decentralition Dillema in Education IT](http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2010/01/the-centralisation-dilemma-in-educational-it.html) ([one of the PLENK2010 week 2 readings](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+2)) and I thought I’d use audioBoo.fm to say a few words about what we have at Swansea.

Here’s the recording:

Martin will be a guest presenter at the Wednesday Elluminate session later today and it will be interesting to see what he has to say and how the course facilitators and course members respond.
