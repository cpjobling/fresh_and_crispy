> You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

– Inigo Montoya, the (film of) _[The Princess Bride](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/)_. Novel and screenplay by William Goldman.

This week, I was in [Gegynog](http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/UniversityConferenceCentre/GregynogHall.aspx) at the final meeting of the [Gwella](http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/gwella/?page_id=2) participants. While there, a few people mentioned the phrase _digital literacy_. A variation of the phrase cropped up in the [introduction to the readings](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+6) for Week 6 of #PLENK2010 (see the Wordle above). It’s also a key theme of Robin Good and Howard Rheingold’s post [New Media Literacy in Education](http://www.masternewmedia.org/learning_educational_technologies/media-literacy/new-media-literacy-critical-thinking-Howard-Rheingold-20071019.htm) which was one of the readings. Furthermore, it popped up in Wednesday’s discussion as [reported earlier](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/10/digital-literacy-passion-and-changing.html).  

Like the [Dread Pirate Roberts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_Pirate_Roberts) who keeps climbing the sheer cliffs after Vizzini has cut the rope:

> [HE DIDN’T FALL? INCONCEIVABLE](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes?qt0482717)?

The persistence of this phrase makes me think that it’s a topic that I can get my teeth into for the remaining four weeks of PLENK 2010. Perhaps I’ll be able to find out what it means.
