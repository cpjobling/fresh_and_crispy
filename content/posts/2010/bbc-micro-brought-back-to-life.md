Really liked this story that was a small item on Todayâ€™s Today programme. Students on A level computing course being let into The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park to programme the BBC micro (in BBC Basic) in order to learn how computers really work.

Visit the link for a more detailed article, background to the BBC Micro, and video from BBC News team.
