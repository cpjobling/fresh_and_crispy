I love this video from the first lecture of \[CS 106A Programming Methodology\](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/) (Recorded in Fall 2008). Apart from the enthusiasm of the lecturer Mehran Sahami, which is infectious, it’s a great source of inspiration for learning and teaching:

\- Grading without numbers - The Stanford Honour Code (approach to Plagiarism) - Use of undergraduates for peer/mentor support (even grading!) - Use of sugary snacks as rewards for contribution - Use of continuous assessment with later work given more marks to encourage work to the end - Midterm tests - Personalized feedback via “interactive marking” - 2 Free days for late submission of coursework – avoids extensions.

Not sure how we could do it all … but there must some of this which has to be worth trying. The video embedded below is hosted on YouTube and can be downloaded and redistributed under a Creative Commons (Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works) license.

\[There is a YouTube channel for the whole course\](http://www.youtube.com/view\_play\_list?p=84A56BC7F4A1F852).

The follow-on course, \[CS106B Programming Abstractions\](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/) (See \[YouTube channel for CS106B\](http://www.youtube.com/view\_play\_list?p=FE6E58F856038C69)), was also recorded in the 2008 academic year. The lecturer that year, Julie Zelenski, is also a great performer, but the course is also worth noting because it’s the first example I’ve seen where there’s a Facebook link page embedded in the course web site.
