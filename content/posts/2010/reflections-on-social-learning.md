Just remotely attended Jane Hart’s keynote [Social Learning = New Toolset + New Skillset + New Mindset](http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2010/05/collaborative-keynote.html) at [EdTech 2010](http://ilta.net/ocs/index.php/edtech2010/Edtech2010) which was streamed live from the Athlone Institute of Technology on Thursday 20th May, 2010. It was very interesting because Jane encouraged the audience, both in the room, and logged in from the Internet, to help her to deliver the keynote by tweeting answers to some key questions as she went along. The actual slides are on SlideShare and hopefully the video of the keynote was recorded and will be made available as a permanent resource later.

The questions asked are worthy of some deeper reflection, but here is a summary of my instant responses:

Q1: _Which social media tool has impacted you most – personally or professionally?_

The answer has to be Blogger (or perhaps blogging). It’s the one thing that I’ve done consistently since I became aware that I was engaged in social media. I have accounts and have shared on Buzz, Delicious, Flickr, Picasa, YouTube, SlideShare, Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, Posterous, Tumblr, Ning and on and on … but the centre of my network is still this blog. It’s arguably not that social, but I share an awful lot on Google reader too.

  

Q2: _Would you rate Twitter as your TOP tool for learning?_

No! Personally, I learn more from my news feeds in Google reader. For teaching, I’ve yet to find the magic formula that will get my students to engage with me or my courses on Twitter.

  

Q3: Formal Learning Models, _do you use social media as an 1) add-on to formal learning, 2) embedded with formal learning or 3) for collaborative learning?_

The best I can claim here is 2. I’d like to do more 3, but I’m not sure how – or indeed how it would fit in our formal, traditional university models. To paraphrase: “no one ever got fired for using Blackboard!” (or indeed a blackboard) and formal examinations.

  

Q4: _If you are looking for help or information on a subject, where do you go first?_

  

It has to be Google. Jane mentioned YouTube and yes, I do find more and more useful stuff there in a format that’s easy to digest. Wikipedia is also on my list of useful places, but I find information there mostly because it’s high on the Google search result, not because I’ve gone to Wikipedia to find it. Google’s also behind the Open location field in all my favourite browsers, so I hardly ever use bookmarks: and Delicious is mostly write only!

  

Q5: What collaboration tool do you like?

  

I have no good answer for this. I like Google docs and Wikis, but I’ve yet to find a colleague who liked one or other of these at the same time as me! Most of my “collaborative” work has been with myself! I find myself commenting more than I used to on blogs and social networks if that counts! Perhaps I need a project where collaboration is a necessity. Even my work colleagues have so far resisted the charms of SharePoint, and though many use the VLE, not many seem to have recognized the value of the wiki there! I also note resistance from my students.

  

Q6: do you use enterprise-wide social tools?

  

Yammer took off at Swansea U. for a while: but it’s usage seems to have been embraced by a particular sub-group of the staff and there’s not much learning support there. I’ve played with Ning and Elgg and both have potential for both student and staff use. Ning decided to charge just as I’d started to generate some interest in using it for intra\-organizational learning.

So what did I learn? Is social networking in my personal learning environment … definitely. In my teaching? The jury’s out, but this talk may have inspired me to try harder!

All in all an excellent keynote and a very interesting back-channel (Twitter certainly works at e-learning conferences!) The whole conversation is available by following [#edtech10](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23edtech10) on Twitter Search. But of course, that’s the whole conference, so look for [@c4lpt](http://twitter.com/c4lpt) and [#edtech10](http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=6991676) together; ([#edtech10+@c4lpt](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23edtech10+%40c4lpt)) and follow the stream from the first tweet.
