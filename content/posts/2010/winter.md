Winter has come early this year. No snow yet in Swansea, but cold enough for frost.

For more see [Frost](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157625415102573/) on Flickr, and listen to Dylan reading his poem [A Winter’s Tail](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xfwm7z_dylan-thomas-a-winter-s-tale_creation) (curated by Poetictouch.com), which seems quite appropriate.
