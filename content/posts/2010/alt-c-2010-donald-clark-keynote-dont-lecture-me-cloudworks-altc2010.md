One advantage of not being at the ALT-C conference is that I can only attend the keynotes and invited speaker sessions on Eluminate. I therefore have a lot of time to watch the twitter stream and curate the links. Cloudworks has a “cloud” for all the talks at this year’s ALT-C gathering (in Nottingham) and I’ve been busy adding references and links to the cloud for Donald Clark’s keynote — a lecture on the evils of lectures that really got the attendees — present and remote — going!

One question that I always have is why keynote speakers rarely feel the need to provide their slides!
