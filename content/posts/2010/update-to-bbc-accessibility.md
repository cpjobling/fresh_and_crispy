Interesting follow-up to yesterday’s [mobile web accessibility](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/08/mobile-accessibility.html) post ([#thereisawebappforthat](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23thereisawebappforthat)).

When demonstrating mobile web page accessibility to my wife, I went direct to the BBC web site ([http://www.bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk)). Interestingly, this page recognizes that I was using a mobile device and switched to a presentation suitable for a mobile (See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/web/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/web/) for a live demo). [](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5333628&id=647941866 "Image of the BBC mobile web site from the BBC mobile web http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/web Uploaded with the Flock Browser - http://www.flock.com")Clicking through from here gets you to the news site [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/) and this is accessible to mobiles. The question is then why doesn’t a link to [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news%20) redirect you to the mobile version? Could it be a simple omission?

Incidentally, I wrote this post with the Flock “The Social Browser” blog post editor and the image was auto uploaded and shared from my Facebook account.
