Last week I wrote a blog posting on the Swansea Learning Lab about the [new-to-uk Amazon Kindle](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/2010/08/kindle.html) and a followup in Reflections about [textbook availabilty](http://swan-ac-uk.campuspack.eu/Users/Chris.Jobling/Reflections/2010/08/Kindle_for_textbooks) and prices. I’ve actually been a long term subscriber to O’Reilly’s Safari Books online service ([http://www.safaribooksonline.com/](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/)) , which for $42.99 (about £27) per month (which includes VAT), gives me access to the entire O’Reilly catalogue as well as many offerings from Addison Wesley, John Wiley and other familiar textbook publishers. Now $42.99 a month is not in the reach of students, but the “lite” offering of a 5 book “bookshelf” subscription for $9.99 might be. And of further interest is that as the books are made available on a web site and there is a mobile version [m.safaribooksonline.com](m.safaribooksonline.com) that works with mobiles and the Kindle.
