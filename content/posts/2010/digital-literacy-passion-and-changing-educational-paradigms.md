On Sunday, I finally found the time to listen to the recording of guest Will Richardson, author of [Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms](http://www.amazon.com/Blogs-Wikis-Podcasts-Powerful-Classrooms/dp/1412927676), from Wednesday’s #PLENK2010 [live Elluminate session](https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-10-20.0934.M.340DDA914E66190DED68B759DCF9C3.vcr&sid=2008104). In this session, Will gave a short presentation _[Using PLE’s Successfully](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=ah8n38hnwpnq_781fmhhkm64)_ and a couple of things came up.

First was a summary of the recommendations on **21st Century\* \*Literacies** from the US National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) \[1\]:

*   Develop proficiency with the tools of technology
*   Build relationships with others to pose and solve problems collaboratively and cross-culturally
*   Design and share information for global communities to use for a variety of purposes
*   Manage, analyze and synthesize multiple streams of simultaneous information
*   Create, critique, analyze, and evaluate multi-media texts
*   Attend to the ethical responsibilities required by these complex environments.

This is a pretty sophisticated set of competences that I would struggle to demonstrate. It’s even more challenging, when you consider that these are the aspirations of a professional body for teachers of \*high-school age\* children! Do we even do this for our undergraduate and postgraduate students? Would I and my colleagues be competent to teach these high-level \*\*digital literacies \*\*\[2\] to them?

The second theme was a set of principles for creating and successfully using a PLE: - Pursue your passion. - Read widely. - Filter. - Share. - Add value. - Be personal … sometimes. - Manage/balance.

I can see how these principles might apply to my own PLE, which for me is centred around this and the \[Learning Lab blog\](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/). But it’s not quite so obvious how it might apply to our students. Too often, we try to get them to engage with the tools of a PLE by telling them that it’s \*good\* for them, and we then try to get them to engage with a topic related to a course we are teaching or a topic within a course of \*our\* choosing, and we try to force them to engage by assigning credit. Would they engage more if they were able to \*pursue their passion\* while we supported their learning as mentors rather than assessors?

In the discussion, will mentioned the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) animation \[Changing Education Paradigms\](http://comment.rsablogs.org.uk/2010/10/14/rsa-animate-changing-education-paradigms/) which is based on a \[speech given to the RSA by Sir Ken Robinson\](http://www.thersa.org/events/vision/archive/sir-ken-robinson) \[3\]. An idea, and its presentation, well worth sharing.
