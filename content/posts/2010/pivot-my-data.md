A couple of TED 2010 highlights that I stumbled on today. First [Tim Berners-Lee reports on year one](http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_year_open_data_went_worldwide.html) of his “[More Data Now](http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html)” campaign. Next I finally got around to [watching Gary Flake on the data visualization](http://www.ted.com/talks/gary_flake_is_pivot_a_turning_point_for_web_exploration.html) features of [Microsoft Livelabs Pivot](http://www.getpivot.com/) (which I first saw reported on Swansea Yammer network a few weeks ago).

Try to find 30 minutes to watch all three videos then reflect like I did on what might be possible when Pivot and linked data colide!

It could be revolutionary – both for the citizen and for education!
