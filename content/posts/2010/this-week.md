… I’ve been mostly

*   developing a new version of my project allocation tool in Drupal (permissions, CCK and views,.. oh my!);
*   re-launching the annual research project selection round in Blackboard; and
*   re-launching Social Engineering as a self-hosted Elgg site.

In the meantime, last-year’s research projects have been winding down (submission deadline was yesterday and vivas are in two-weeks), and we’ve been winding up to asking colleagues for the 500 or so new projects we are going to need for 2010-2011.
