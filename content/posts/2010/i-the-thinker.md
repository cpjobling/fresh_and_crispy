At PLENK2010 participant Heli Nurmi’s request (see [Test Your Blog Please](http://helistudies.edublogs.org/2010/10/15/test-your-blog-please/comment-page-1/#comment-327)), I submitted the URL of this blog to [http://www.typealyzer.com/](http://www.typealyzer.com/) to have it subjected to a Myers-Briggs personality test. It turns out that these scribblings reveal me to be an INTP type (_The Thinker_)

> The logical and analytical type. They are especially attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.
> 
> They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as_\* arrogant, impatient and insensitive_\* to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.

I’ll have to think about that!
