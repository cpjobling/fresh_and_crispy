Today I presented a “Lunch and Learn Session” to colleagues at our Staff Development Unit. Here are the slides which are hosted at Google Docs.

The creation of a Ning network was a highlight of the session, and unfortunately that bit is not present here, but the \*intro\* and \*outro\* may nevertheless be of some interest.

There is also a \[SlideShare version\](http://www.slideshare.net/cpjobling/a-beginners-guide-to-social-engineering) which includes some extra video which I may get around to narrating and including a screencast demo of Ning site creation. Watch this space!
