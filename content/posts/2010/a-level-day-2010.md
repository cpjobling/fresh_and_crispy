Today is the day that A levels results are released to students and their parents. For the first time in as long as I can remember, the news media has not been obsessed with grade inflation. The estimated 175,000 students who won’t get a place has moved that old chestnut off top spot. That said, universities which [told a Guardian poll last week that they were full](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/aug/09/universities-clearing-turn-away-students) are suddenly able to take _well qualified students_ ([Clearing 2010: Universities offer lifeline to top students](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/aug/18/clearing-2010-universities-offer-lifeline), The Guardian).

This is also the first year that the A\* grade – awarded for grades of 90% and above – has been made available. \[Few universities used it in making offers\](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/aug/17/a-levels-a-grade-universities), but more may use it in clearing.

The story is unfolding on the \[BBC\](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11012369), \[The Guardian\](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education), \[The Daily Telegraph\](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/), and \[The Independent\](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/).

The Times is behind a pay wall.
