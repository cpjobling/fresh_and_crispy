Week 7 in PLENK2010 was concerned with [PLE/N tools](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+7) (What Exists, What is Being Built?):

> Many of the tools that fit under the PLE/N umbrella have been appropriated by educators from other fields. This isn’t necessarily a problem, but it does reflect a sense that educators are not building tools for themselves. The software that we use in this course is a bit of an exception. We \[_the facilitators_\] rely on various open source tools (Moodle, WordPress), proprietary tools (Elluminate), and tools that have been developed with feedback from facilitators and experiences in other open courses (i.e. Stephen \[_Downes_\] has written the software for [The Daily](http://connect.downes.ca/thedaily.htm) and content aggregation – [gRSShopper](http://grsshopper.downes.ca/)).
> 
> To use these tools for teaching and learning requires a certain skill set on the part of end users. Two significant challenges exist for educators and PLE/Ns:  
> 1\. Create new tools – what do we need? What functionality is missing in PLEs? 2. Improve end user experience – new tools, new interfaces, and ease of use.

For me, the highlight of the week was the Wednesday discussion ([Elluminate recording here](https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-10-27.0813.M.340DDA914E66190DED68B759DCF9C3.vcr&sid=2008104)) in which Maria Andersen presented her ideas on a new transformative personal learning idea _Learn This_ based on the simple idea that “learning should simply be by way of Socratic questioning, where questions are rephrased as answers.” \[1\]

Knowing little about [Socrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), the [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates#Socratic_method) or [dialectics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) (apart from a vague recollection of an episode of [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007zp21)), I was keen to explore how the Socratic questioning might work. So I turned the week’s questions into a discussion [Socratic questions about PLENK](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=453) in which I posed the questions:

> *   What new tools do we need to create?
> *   What functionality is missing in PLEs?
> *   How could we improve the learner’s experience?

The discussion that followed has been wide ranging and extremely interesting. It even attracted the spirit of Socrates himself. Furthermore, it is still ongoing, so I will not attempt to summarize it here.

As PLENK moves into Week 8 ([Personal Knowledge Management](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+8)) I’m still not sure what a personalized learning system based on _“Socratic questioning where questions are rephrased as answers”_ would look like in practice. But herewith, I open up the debate to a wider audience.
