I’ve just got back to work after breaking my ankle five weeks ago and I’ve just started catching up with things in e-learning and beyond. I thought I’d enumerate a few things that are on my radar. Just a list with links for now:

\- Blackboard 9 coming soon to Swansea U. - \[Delicious Bookmark Browse feature\](http://cogdogblog.com/2010/07/07/delicious-browsing/) (thanks to CogDogBlog). Useful for creating a presentation based on web sites. Try this one for resources I’ve collected on \[plagiarism\](http://delicious.com/browsebar/user/cpjobling/plagiarism). - Open source learning object building toolkit \[Xerte\](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xerte/index.htm) (thanks to Helen Davies at the Swansea Learning Lab). - The \[WolframAlpha\](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) search engine from Wolfram research (and \*Mathematica\*). Good introduction and interview with \[Conrad Wolfram\](http://www.conradwolfram.com/) in the \[June 9th Edition of the Guardian Tech Weekly Podcast\](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/audio/2010/jun/08/apple-iphone-conrad-wolfram-alpha-search). Try: \[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=7+May,+1959\](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=7+May,+1959). - \[EduGlu\](http://eduglu.com/) — a social network builder for education based on Drupal. Very early stages of development, but one to watch.
