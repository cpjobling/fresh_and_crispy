Next year I’ve got a fairly busy schedule. Here are some things that I might be blogging about. I record them here as an aide memoir:

*   Large group assessment
*   The “Flip”
*   Socratic questioning
*   Peer Instruction, Assessment and Support
*   LiveScribe Echo
*   Social networks
*   Student employability and entrepreneurship. 

Technically, I expect to be playing with Drupal, WordPress, BuddyPress, Moodle and Elgg and maybe, if there’s time, Ruby on Rails 3. I might submit something (probably a poster) to ALT-C 2011.

I also realise that I should take the opportunity to take a look back at a year on _Fresh and Crispy_, so expect a post on that before December 31st.
