This week I am attending the JISC-sponsored online conference [Innovating eLearning 2010](http://www.online-conference.co.uk/WebX/jisc/2010/). Any posts I make here or in the [Community Blog](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/) are likely to be on my reflections from this conference. The conference is for paying delegates only, but some materials are out in the public Internet, and I’ll refer to them where appropriate. The twitter back-channel is using the hash-tag [#jiscel10](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23jiscel10).
