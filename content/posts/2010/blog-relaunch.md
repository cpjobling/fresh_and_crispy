Today I got a reminder from Google that the annual domain registration for my semi-defunct Google Apps account was due. Having also seen a service email from Blogger.com telling me that [FTP support was being withdrawn](http://buzz.blogger.com/2010/01/important-note-to-ftp-users.html) and suggesting that I consider using a [custom domain](http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/01/blogger-custom-domains.html), I thought Iâ€™d take the opportunity to renew my domain and use it to host this blog. Sort of like a vanity plate for the Internet age! So from now on you can access my words of wisdom at blog.cpjobling.org. Please update your links: you can still reach me via crispyj2.blogspot.com which will redirect you.
