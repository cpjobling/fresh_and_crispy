At the end of the Beatles’ seminal Sergeant Pepper album is the track “A Day in the Life.” Those who’ve heard it will know that right at the end of the track, and therefore the album, is the climax in which an orchestra works itself up into a frenzy of noise before a single piano chord brings the whole thing to an end.

PLENK2010 has been like being in that orchestra this week. An awful lot of **sound and fury** (signifying nothing?). I’m prepared to believe that learning could be an emergent property of a MOOC, but I for one am glad to hear the closing chord.

We’re promised fun with the [neXT/eXtended web next week](http://ple.elg.ca/course/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=60&page=Week+3). Let’s hope it is.
