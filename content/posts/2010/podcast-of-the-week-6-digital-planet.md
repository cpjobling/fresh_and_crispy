[Digital Planet from the BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/science/2009/03/000000_digital_planet.shtml) was one of the earliest podcasts that I picked up when I got my first MP3 player — which wasn’t an iPod! I’ve been listening to it every week for several years and it’s never short of informative. It’s a technology podcast, similar to The Guardian’s TechWeekly (see [POTW #2](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/08/podcast-of-week-2-tech-weekly.html)), so it covers the latest news from Google, Apple and Microsoft and the various technology shows and conferences. But it’s Unique Selling Point is that, because it’s a [BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/) programme, it has a global viewpoint which covers the developing world as much as what’s happening in silicon valley. Digital Planet is presented by Gareth Michell with excellent punditry from “technology expert” Bill Thompson who also blogs [independently](http://www.thebillblog.com/billblog/) and occasionally for BBC Technology News (e.g. [Clicking the Blue ‘e’](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11150367)).

Like a lot of podcasts, there is an active community around a [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4287320286) and both Gareth (@garethm) and Bill (@billt) tweet.
