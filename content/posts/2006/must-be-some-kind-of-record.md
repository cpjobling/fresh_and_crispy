Talk about information overload! I currently have 1675 unread items on my main blog roll in \[Bloglines\](http://www.bloglines.com). I just exported the OPML file of my subscriptions and imported it into \[Flock’s\](http://www.flock.com) RSS aggregator but as I’m sure that this only shows a few days worth, I’ll feel guilty forever unless I go through the list on Bloglines. I have to say Flock’s RSS reader is lovely to look at and very slick. If it also stored the subscriptions (and reading history) on the web as Bloglines does, it’d be a definite candidate to replace Bloglines. Maybe Bloglines and Flock will come to a similar arrangement to that in place for Flickr, del.icio.us and blogger. technorati tags:\[blogging\](http://technorati.com/tag/blogging), \[bloglines\](http://technorati.com/tag/bloglines), \[flock\](http://technorati.com/tag/flock), \[rss\](http://technorati.com/tag/rss), \[aggregation\](http://technorati.com/tag/aggregation), \[browser\](http://technorati.com/tag/browser)
