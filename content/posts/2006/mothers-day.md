This entry is really an excuse to use Picassa which I’ve just installed along with the Google Desktop Package. [Picassa](http://picasa.google.com/) has the best UI for photo album work that I’ve seen and it also produces great CDs for exchange with friends. An it’s free! [![Posted by Picasa](http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif)](http://picasa.google.com/blogger/)
