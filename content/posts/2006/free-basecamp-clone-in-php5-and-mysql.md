As [reported today on TechCrunch](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch?m=1030) Serbian developer Ilija Studen has released a free clone of the popular project management service [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/). Studenâ€™s product is called [ActiveCollab](http://www.activecollab.com). It differs from Basecamp (a hosted web application for which, if you have more than one project or a team larger than 2, you pay a monthly subscription to use) in that the product is free and open source. It is also a PHP5/MySQL application that indiduals, small companies, and even, presumably, Universities can download and install on their own web server. Not sure what code quality and community support is or will be like, but certainly one to watch I think.
