While visiting [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) to read the article on [Project Zero](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/rest-project-zero) that prompted my [last blog entry](/2008/01/better-web-application-framework_22.html), I noticed that there was a [video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/fortress-steele) on [Fortress](http://projectfortress.sun.com/Projects/Community/) (the new scientific programming language for the Java Virtual Machine that I first blogged about [some time ago](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/01/fortess-intepreter.html)). In the video, recorded at the [JAOO 2006 Conference](http://www.jaoo.dk/jaoo2006/conference/), Guy Steele’s keynote _The Soul of a New Programming Language_ gives a nice overview to the language and its philosophy. As a former MATLAB power user and ex-Fortran programmer, I find the Fortress language, particularly its use of mathematical notation, very intriguing and worthy of further investigation.

Why prevarication? Because I’m supposed to be marking exams!
