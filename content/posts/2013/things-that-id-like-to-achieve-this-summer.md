It’s summer. And of course the world believes that academics do nothing over the summer. Well, apart from the summer resit examinations that have to be set and marked, course preparation and undergraduate project allocation that has to be done, I’d agree there isn’t _much_ to be done. But it _is_ a period of the year for which there can be time which can be set aside for personal self-development projects.

On my list this year, I have

*   Learn to touch type
*   Become proficient in VIM
*   Find a way to use mark-down on Blackboard

For the first of these, this [web site](http://www.typeonline.co.uk/index.html) looks useful. There are a [couple](https://leanpub.com/painless_vim) of [books](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) and [loads of video resources](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=vim&tbm=vid) for the second. Suggestions welcomed for the third.
