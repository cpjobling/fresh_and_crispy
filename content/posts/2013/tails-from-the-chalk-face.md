It’s summer so there must be time to blog! Right?

Ignoring the fact that I failed to follow through on my [last promise to do better](http://blog.cpjobling.me/2012/12/06/need-to-blog-again/ "Need to blog again!"), I’ve decided that after surviving another year of _Interesting Times_ (See [Alleged Mandarin Curse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times "May you live in interesting times")) there are a few “tales from the chalkface” that I could usefully recount. So watch this space!

I’ll also try to reboot by [366 Crispy Things](http://www.tumblr.com/blog/366crispythings "366 Crispy Things on Tumblr") blog to provide a daily serving of goodness.
