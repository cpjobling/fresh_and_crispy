In Blackboard, the title of an assignment submission is black and it looks like an ordinary heading. When you mouse over it, the underline appears and it looks like a link. But if you just look at it, it’s not obvious that it is a link! In response to feedback, I’ve now changed the colour of my assignments to dark blue. (See example).

Colour assignment title so It Looks More Like a Link

I’ve also added a textual note below the link to make it extra clear and I’ve provide a web link to the [Blackboard help page on Assignment Submissions for students](https://help.blackboard.com/en-us/Learn/9.1_SP_10_and_SP_11/Student/060_Tests_and_Assignments/Submitting_Assignments).

The blue in my link is a bit too light when compared to the attachments on the item, so if anyone knows what the CSS colour code for a link should be, I’d be grateful if you could add it to the comments.
