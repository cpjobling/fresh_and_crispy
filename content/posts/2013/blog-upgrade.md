[![WordPress 3.6 with 2013 Theme](http://blog.cpjobling.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wp-2013-300x222.png)](http://blog.cpjobling.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wp-2013.png) I’ve just upgraded to the new [3.6 release of WordPress](http://wordpress.org/news/2013/08/oscar/) and switched to the new default [Twenty Thirteen](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/twenty-thirteen/) theme. What do you think? P.S. It’s an HTML5 theme (good for case studies if you’re teaching web applications) and it works great on an iPhone!
