Swansea University, where I work, has quietly established a WordPress blogging system that anyone who has a University login can use to create a blog. This means that I no longer need to worry about providing something myself and should also make introducing blogging to my students a breaze. I created my blog, which I’m calling [@the.coalface](http://blog.swansea.ac.uk/blog/eechris/), and I intend to use it for reflective issues around e-learning, my teaching, research and University life in general. I’ll still continue to use this blog for more generally interesting postings, but it may become less work focussed.
