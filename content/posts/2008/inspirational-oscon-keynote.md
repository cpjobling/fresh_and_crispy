Nat Torkington lives in New Zealand and has spent the last couple of years volunteering as a sysadmin, computer club organizer, and teacher at his local primary school. He shares his experiences of teaching programming to 8-12 year olds in his [blog](http://nathan.torkington.com/blog/2008/05/11/teaching-kids-computer-skills-and-programming/) (and also on [O’Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/05/teaching-kids-programming.html)) as well as in this inspirational talk from OSCON 2008. His conclusion, a call to arms for geeks everywhere to help their local schools, is inspirational. But I was struck in particular by his observation that girls in this age group are better than boys in most skills required to be successful programmers: what happens between primary school and University that so drastically reduces their interest in ICT and, by extension, the other sciences?
