[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/76ca6-img_0042-3.jpg?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/76ca6-img_0042-3.jpg) Today’s [365 Photos Project](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157606849407938/) choice came down to this abstract view of the new student accomodation and an [autumnal view of fallen leaves](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/2965363634/) taken in Singleton park. The leaves won out today, but I liked this too and thought it was also worth sharing.
