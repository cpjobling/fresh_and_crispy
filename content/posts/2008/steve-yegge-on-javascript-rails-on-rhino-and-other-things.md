Back in [June](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/06/next-big-language-nbl.html) I blogged about Steve Yegge’s port of Ruby on Rails to Rhino (the JavaScript engine for the JVM) and his claim that JavaScript was the _Next Big Language_ (NBL). In related news, Dion Almaer has just posted a new video interview (in the [Google Code Blog](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com) series) of Steve Yegge himself [talking](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/01/interview-with-steve-yegge-on-rhino-on.html) about the Ruby on Rhino project, server-side and client side JavaScript. Its always nice to be able to put faces and voices to the names of people who have interesting ideas, and whose [Blogs](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com) I am following. It’ll also be interesting to see what comes out of [this project](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html) which Steve is pursuing at Google.
