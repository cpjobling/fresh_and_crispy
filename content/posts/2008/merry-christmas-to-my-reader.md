Jumping on the [bandwagon](http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2008/12/a-christmas-card-from-jane.html), I though I would share this picture taken last year of the Eich MÃ¼hle, on the Regen in Regesnstauf in a very Christmassy Bavaria. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a safe and prosperous New Year!
