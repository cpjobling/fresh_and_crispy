As \[reported yesterday\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-io-day.html), I’ve been catching up with a number of presentations from the \[Google I/O 2008 conference\](http://sites.google.com/site/io/google-io-sessions). However, I just had to draw particular attention to one of the highlights which is this recording of a very entertaining presentation from Chris di Bona who is Open Source Programs Manager at Google. In an engaging, anecdotal style, Chris covers the history and philosophy of Open Source (which includes a name check for Swansea’s very own \[Alan Cox\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan\_Cox)) and how Google relies on it, promotes it and develops some of its own. The video is on and the \[original link to the talk\](http://sites.google.com/site/io/open-source-is-magic) includes the slides (which I assume are re-usable).
