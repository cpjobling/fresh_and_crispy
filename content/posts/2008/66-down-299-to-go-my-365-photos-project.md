p>I’ve been taking a photograph a day to post on Flickr for 66 days now, and to celebrate I thought I’d post the slide show. Rugby, Rain and the views on the way to and from Work are the recurring theme so far. I wonder what’s to come! There are a number of these 365 photo a day groups on Flickr, but if you want to join the group I’m in, head over to [Project 365](http://www.flickr.com/groups/project_365/).
