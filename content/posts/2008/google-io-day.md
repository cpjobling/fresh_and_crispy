Last month Google hosted the first of its Google I/O conferences in San Francisco. I’d like to report that I was there, but I wasn’t (although I [did watch the keynote](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2008/05/google-i0-2008-keynote.html) the day after it was given). The video recordings of the speakers (hosted on YouTube) and their slides (mostly shared on Google Docs) that have been [on-line](http://sites.google.com/site/io/google-io-sessions) for a few weeks now. With term finally over, I can become a virtual conference delegate and today was my first chance to catch up with some of the more interesting talks. If you’ve been [following me](http://twitter.com/cpjobling) on Twitter you’ll note that I watched/will be watching:

*   Steve Yegge’s [presentation](http://sites.google.com/site/io/server-side-javascript-on-the-java-virtual-machine) on Server-Side Scripting with Rhino \[more philosophy than technology\]
*   Guido van Rossum’s [demonstration of the Google App Engine](http://sites.google.com/site/io/rapid-development-with-python-django-and-google-app-engine)
*   Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman (Google) telling the world about [Google’s open source project hosting platform](http://sites.google.com/site/io/introduction-to-project-hosting-on-google-code)
*   Aaron Boodman’s and Chris Prince’s talks about \[Google\] Gears and its potential for [implementing parts of HTML 5](http://sites.google.com/site/io/html5-brought-to-you-by-gears) and [extending the web browser](http://sites.google.com/site/io/improving-browsers-in-new-ways-gears)
*   John Skidgel and Lindsey Simon on [engaging web app users](http://sites.google.com/site/io/engaging-user-experiences-with-google-app-engine) \[with Google App Engine, but I’m sure that the lessons are universal\] and
*   Josh Bloch on the new [Effective Java](http://sites.google.com/site/io/effective-java-reloaded) book.

There are lots more talks to view and lessons to be learnt, and it’d be great if more big companies and conference organizers did this sort of thing.
