After today’s \*lunch and learn\* session on \[Web2.0 at the Chalkface\](http://swansea-learninglab.blogspot.com/2008/05/swanevent-lunch-learn-web-20-at.html), Paul Latreille inspired me to have another look at \[Netvibes\](http://www.netvibes.com/). I’ve been playing with it on and off since I got home this evening and I’ve launched another version of \[my life online\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2008/05/stalk-me.html) as a Netvibes public page. See \[www.netvibes.com/crispyj\](http://www.netvibes.com/crispyj) for more. Come on over and be my friend.

My new public “stalk me” page on Netvibes

Not sure which of T\[umblr\](http://cpjobling.tumblr.com/), \[Friendfeed \](http://friendfeed.com/cpjobling)and \[Netvibes \](http://www.netvibes.com/crispyj%20)that I prefer. But I guess the real question is \*which do you\* prefer? Perhaps you could leave me a comment to let me know.
