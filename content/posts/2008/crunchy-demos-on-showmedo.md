André Roberge has created [three screencasts](http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=jBz4yv8Xg) on the use of [Crunchy](http://crunchy.sourceforge.net/). Crunchy is an interactive Python interpretor that runs inside the Firefox browser and can be used to create interactive Python tutorials, library documentation, demos and tests. The principle is similar to “docucentric design” which was explored by one of my [PhD students](http://voyager.swan.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=399427). The key benefit of the Crunchy approach is that documents are just web pages with embedded tasks. It is worth investigating whether Crunchy can be combined with a wiki to add some value to my current research project.
