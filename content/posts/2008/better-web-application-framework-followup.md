While going through my feed-reader today, I [came across](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/project-zero-cuomo) another potential framework, which I can add to the list mentioned [earlier](/2008/01/better-web-application-framework.html). This is [Project Zero](http://www.projectzero.org/), an incubator project being developed by IBM. It uses the Java platform and the scripting languages Groovy and/or PHP and seems to be directly targetted at [RESTful services development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) but with support for traditional web applications, AJAX and mashups. I guess that I am going to have to I develop a data model and evaluate the choices that I have before I get even more confused!
