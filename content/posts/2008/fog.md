[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/584cb-dsc_0043.jpg?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/584cb-dsc_0043.jpg) Today it was foggy. Possibly the first fog of the winter. I was too late out of bed to capture the best of it, but this shot over the lake in Brynmill Park, added today to my [Autumn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157607863614595/) and [Weather](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157610411180320/) collections on Flickr, was the most authentic “Foggy” picture that I managed to get.
