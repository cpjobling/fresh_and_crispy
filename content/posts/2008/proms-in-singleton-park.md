The BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales, conducted by **David Charles Abell** and Soloists Rebecca Evans (Three Costume Changes!) and Alfie Boe kept us all entertained for the three hours of the concert itself and the rehersals, which as early arrivals, we also got to see. The usual link ups with the Last Night in the Albert Hall (which incuded a new orchestral piece created for the occasion, and had contributions from all six last night venues) seemed to go without a hitch. I recorded the whole lot on my V+ Box at home so Iâ€™ll be reliving it all again soon. More pictures on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157607282255786/).
