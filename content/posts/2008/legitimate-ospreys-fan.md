Today, I picked up my first [Ospreys](http://www.ospreysrugby.co.uk/) season ticket (actually the first season ticket of any description) so I’m all set for a year of live Magner’s League, Anglo-Welsh and European cup rugby at the [Liberty Stadium](http://www.liberty-stadium.com/). First game is [Shane William’s testimonial](http://www.ospreysrugby.com/ospreys_news_view.php?news_id=1012) against Leicester Tigers tomorrow!
