Continuing the saga of the Firefox 3 (FF3) trial, I just installed the beta version of the del.icio.us plugin for Firefox 3 (see [previous post](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2008/05/firefox-3-rc1-plugin-incompatibility.html)). Bookmarks are one of the key new features of have FF3 (see [Top 10 Firefox 3 Features](http://lifehacker.com/392160/top-10-firefox-3-features) (Lifehacker) and [Create Your Own Smart Bookmarks](http://cybernetnews.com/2008/05/07/cybernotes-create-your-own-smart-bookmarks-in-firefox-3/#more-12354) on Cybernotes), and I was interested in seeing how they worked with the new plugin. I made a small [Jing screencast](http://www.screencast.com/t/0ZIiU6k84L) (sorry no sound) which shows that the del.icio.us plugin works much the same way as it did on FF2 with one small difference. If you bookmark using FF3 bookmarks, a pop-up asks you if you want to also bookmark at del.icio.us too. This might prove either to be useful or annoying depending on how you regard pop-ups! \[A similar feature was already present in the [Flock browser](http://flock.com/)\]

Personally, I rarely use browser-local bookmarks because I move around from machine to machine and rely on the internet to keep my collection in one place and available everywhere. However, perhaps with the advanced bookmarking features added to FF3, the del.icio.us integration and FF3 bookmarking tools may prove to be a winning combination.
