Following on from Chris Hall’s [discovery of Wordle](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/2008/06/tag-cloud-art.html), here’s the [Wordle](http://wordle.net/)\-art tag cloud for my [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling) bookmarks. Interestingly this indicates that I’m a typical geek (look at the size of the [programming](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/programming) and [development](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/development) tags). Interestingly my courses [EG-259](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/eg-259) and [EG-146](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/eg-146) (both on Web Development) feature largely. I’m also apparently keen on the [Web](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/web) and self-improving [tutorials](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/tutorial)! Of course these are only my public tags!
