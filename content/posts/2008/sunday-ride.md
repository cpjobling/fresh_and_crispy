My wife and I took our new bikes along National Cycle Path number 4 from Brynmill to the Mumbles (Verdiâ€™s) then back to Blackpill and up the Clyne Valley to the Railway Inn. A pint of Three Cliffs Gold then back to the Bay Cycle path and home. Comfortable ride, but it is flat! Gorgeous weather today: hope it stays that way.
