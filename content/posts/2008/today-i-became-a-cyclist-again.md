[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5fe18-img_0040.jpg?w=225)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5fe18-img_0040.jpg) After a long hiatus during which our last pair of bikes have been rusting away in the corner of the garden, my wife and I splashed out on a new set of two wheeled touring machines today. Fitness is low: a short trip to the new Swansea Library in the former Guildhall (now “Civic” Center) nearly killed us! Still the wind was blowing in our faces on the way back! More journeys planned, though we’ll need to build up to the Gower circle!
