I am grateful to [OUseful.info](http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/012276.html) for the post that lead me to try out a new Screencasting tool from [TechSmith](http://www.techsmith.com/) called [Jing](http://blog.jingproject.com/). Made by the same company that makes [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp) (an indispensable screen caspture tool) and [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) (a screencasting tool that I covet but can’t afford), Jing is a “couldn’t be simpler” tool for making screencasts that you can share.

The results can be shared with others as videos via (charged for service) [Screencast.com](http://www.screencast.com/) \[see [the headline link](http://www.screencast.com/users/cpjobling/folders/Jing/media/734fdb13-e433-4fa7-8e0a-5eb2fa3470f1) for an example\], as individual images via [flikr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/51214457@N00/2177323967/) (see the image on this post), uploaded to a web site using FTP or saved to disk. It’s a great tool. This should be great for sharing video “how to’s” but as an academic who uses a PC in lectures, it seems possible that I could actually record a lecture with Jing and make it available as a video screencast within minutes of completing a lecture. This is an experiment I’m keen to try next term.

Warning for Vista users: Jing suffers from a problem that I’ve seen with a few apps since upgrading from XP to Vista. When Jing is installed, the user permissions are not set up properly and you have to manually take ownership of the installation folder in Program Files to get it and its shortcuts to show up! After that, it seems to work OK!
