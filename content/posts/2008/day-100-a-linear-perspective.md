On day 100 of my [365 photos project](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2008/10/66-down-299-to-go-my-365-photos-project.html) and itâ€™s getting harder all the time! Short days and long nights make it especially tricky to find interesting subjects! Still I quite liked this view of the Swansea University campus that I spotted on the way in to work this morning. I cropped it quite severely to emphasize the lines and shapes. The autumnal bus in the middle ground is the only thing that has any curves although you can just about see from the shadows that the post in the right-foreground is a cylinder. See the rest of the first 100 shots [here](http://flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157606849407938/ "More from Crispy's 365 Photos Project").
