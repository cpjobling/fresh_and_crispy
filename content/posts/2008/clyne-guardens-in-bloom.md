Itâ€™s May Bank Holiday today and we went for a stroll around Clyne Gardens which is always at its best at this time of year. Azaleas and Rhododendrons are in full bloom and are a riot of reds, purples, yellows and pinks. As usual, more pictures have been posted to \[Flickr\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157604901590749/).
