Today was first day back “at work” and I’ve spent much of it catching up on [OSCON 2008](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home), O’Reilly’s annual open source conference, which was this year held in Portland Oregon between July 21-25. Greg Pollack of the [RailsEnvy Podcast](http://www.railsenvy.com/podcast) has made a nice video introduction to the conference ([OSCON in 37 minutes](http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/7/29/oscon-videos)) in which he gets various luminaries and speakers to introduce their talks and so provide a nice lead-in to the presentations, most of which are on-line, and the keynotes which were video-recorded and made available for syndication via [blip.tv](http://oscon.blip.tv/).
