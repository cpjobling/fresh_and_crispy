Some new features (blogs, wikis, social bookmarking, podcasting) were added to my institution’s Blackboard in the last upgrade. It’s very early days but I managed to try some of these out and blog about my first impressions. Here’s my \[blog entry\](http://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/lobj-journal-bb\_bb60/blog/LOTOOLS/\_332089\_1/20080115\_2). It’s hosted on Blackboard so I’m not sure if it will be publicly visible. My apologies if it isn’t! Some of my views are probably influenced by \[this Slideshare presentation\](http://www.microbiologybytes.com/tutorials/ple/) posted by Alan Cann (of Leicester University) which compares \*Virtual Learning Environments\* (VLEs) and \*Personalised Learning Environments\* (PLEs).
