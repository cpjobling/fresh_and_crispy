[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b88a1-dsc_0385.jpg?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/b88a1-dsc_0385.jpg) Today my wife and I took a walk in Singleton Park and the botanical gardens and I snapped one or two interesting views with my new camera. I love the dramatic silhouettes that large deciduous trees make in the winter!
