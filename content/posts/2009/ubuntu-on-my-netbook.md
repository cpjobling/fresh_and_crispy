[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ab679-screenshot.png?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ab679-screenshot.png)Today I installed Ubuntu 9.04 “Jaunty Jackalope” on my Acer Aspire One netbook. The version is the [Netbook Remix](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-netbook) version and it looks really nice, as the screenshot above will testify. Hopefully it will be easier to link to the University wireless network than the original Asper Aspire (based on Fedora I think) was.

The most difficult part of the installation was getting the image file onto a USB data stick. The windows tool provided didn’t work and I had to use another Linux machine to transfer the data. But once done the installation was a breeze: just boot from the USB stick into a live version and then install from there.

I don’t have any data on the nebook (although I’ve had it a since before Christmas) and if you were upgrading, you’d need to make a data backup first.

If I succeed in connecting my netbook to the University system, I’ll let you know. Having access to a terminal and the apt-get package installer should certainly help!
