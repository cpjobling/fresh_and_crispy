My first year’s “photo-a-day” project ended, as it started, on a rainy day in August. In between, there were many highlights such as Shane Williams’ testimonial with the Ospreys, the Great Dorset Steam fair, Queen Nefertiti, Parties, Christmas in Berlin, a holiday in Yorkshire and the U2 concert in Cardiff.

There are also lots of self portraits, pictures of the cat and images of furniture and furnishings that fill in when no other inspiration beckoned. There are also lots of pictures of the turning seasons as viewed from the path from my house, across Singleton park to the University and back.

Will I continue for another year? Who knows … I have a day to decide!

In the mean time, here are the first and last pictures and here’s a \[link to the slide show\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157606849407938/show/). Play something rousing in the MP3 player and enjoy!
