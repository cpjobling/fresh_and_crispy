I have a lecture next week which will discuss HTML markup. I have lots of notes and examples for XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2 which I think students should read through for some deeper learning rather than be presented in a lecture. I have instead decided to show \[this video\](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siOHh0uzcuY). On searching,I also found this presentation from Google I/0 2009 (the Google developer’s conference) which talks about what’s coming next!

It’s very early days and HTML 5 seems to be being developed in quite a piecemeal way with browser developers emphasizing some features and not others. It may be several years before all of HTML 5 is supported in all browsers, but that doesn’t mean that my students shouldn’t know that it’s coming.
