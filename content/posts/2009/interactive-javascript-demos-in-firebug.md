Giving lectures on code is pretty tedious for both students and staff and it occured to me that more interactivity is required. So I wondered if I could liven up my JavaScript lectures by using Firebug’s JavaScript console. As you can see from this quick “proof of concept” video that I \[made with Screenr\](http://screenr.com/juH), it might just work (and will require little extra effort on my part). I’ll blog again about how it went!
