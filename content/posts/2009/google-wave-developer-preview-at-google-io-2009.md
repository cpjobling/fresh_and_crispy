I’m probably a few days late in bringing this to your attention, here goes anyway! In the Google IO Conference 2009, Google previewed a really interesting new, open-source, open-potocol platform for collaboration called Google Wave (\[wave.google.com\](http://wave.google.com)). This video recording of the keynote, published on the 28th May on YouTube, is well worth a look. The presentation takes about 90 minutes, but it’s worth watching it all because some of the more interesting possibilities (for example simultaneous translation) come later on in the presentation.

This could be the “\[killer app\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer\_application)” that turns Google from search giant to collaborative software giant, and I for one can’t wait to read what others in the Educational and technical blogosphere have to say about it. Also, as Google IO is a developers’ conference, there are many more technical presentations on Google Wave recorded and hosted on the \[Google Developers Channel\](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers).
