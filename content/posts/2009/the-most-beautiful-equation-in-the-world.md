According to some, [Euler’s identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler) is one of the most beautiful mathematical expressions in the world. The identity is  
1 + _e__i?_ = 0 (although electrical engineers like myself are more familiar with seeing it written as 1 + _e__j?_ = 0).

Euler’s Identity, Technical Museum Berlin\*

On a recent visit to the [Mathema Exhibition](http://www.sdtb.de/mathema-Ist-Mathematik-die-Sprache-der-Natur.1258.0.html) at the [German Technical Museum, Berlin](http://www.sdtb.de/Startseite.63.0.html), I took this photo of some art that represents this equation.

Lots of people like to take a break by sitting in the zero.

_Why so beautiful_? Because it neatly ties together five of the most mysterious numbers in Mathematics: 0, 1, _e_, ? and the square root of –1.

_What does it mean_? Euler’s formula is essentially a statement of the transformation from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates for imaginary numbers: that is numbers that have a real part represented as a point on the _x_\-axis, and an imaginary part that is represented by a point on the _y_\-axis. It takes the general form  
\*  
eix\* = cos _x_ +\* i\* sin _x_.

For the special case when _x_ = ?: sin ? = 0 and cos ? = -1, thus _ei?_ = -1 or _ei? +_ 1 = 0.
