In about four weeks I will be giving a lecture to the Level 3 Engineering Dissertation class on proper referencing. I will probably want to cover the following ground:

*   Plagiarism (or how not to reference)
*   How to reference
*   A couple of referencing styles (I was thinking numerical and Havard styles).
*   Referencing tools: Word 2007, Zotero, Endnote.

There is a brief guide to [bibliographic referencing](http://www.swan.ac.uk/lis/HelpAndGuides/bibliographic_referencing/) that has been provided by the Library and Information Service at Swansea University which I will use, but I am also looking for examples of plagiarism that I can cite (properly) and any pointers to good on-line resources for using the referencing tools.

In a (very) brief Google search session I came across this nice [interactive tutorial from Arcadia University](http://library.acadiau.ca/tutorials/plagiarism/) that can be used in the lecture. I will tag others in my delicious feed using tags [eg\-353+referencing](http://delicious.com/cpjobling/eg-353+referencing "View delicious bookmarks").

Hopefully, the resulting presentation will be good enough to join my existing presentation on [How to Write a Technical Report](http://www.slideshare.net/cpjobling/how-to-write-a-technical-report) on SlideShare.
