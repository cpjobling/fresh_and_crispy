I regularly post to three blogs. This one, which used to be work related, is now sort of miscellaneous. I try to keep my other blog [@the.coalface](http://blog.swan.ac.uk/blog/eechris), which is a multi-user WordPress blog hosted at my University, focussed on my reflections on my experiments with education technology. And I am a regular contributor to the [Swansea Learning Lab community blog](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/), where I typically re-post interesting items of e-learning inspiration and that I find in my daily trawl of my RSS feeds. 

However, it seems that I could do even more. As a member of the \[Eduspaces\](http://eduspaces.net/cpjobling/) and \[Classroom2.0\](http://www.classroom20.com/profile/ChrisJobling) community networks, I have two more blogs available to me. As an academic I have an entry on \[Academia.edu\](http://swansea.academia.edu/ChristopherJobling) and could have a blog. I \[microblog\](http://www.twitter.com/cpjobling) on Twitter. I \[share favourites\](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/12981735514196780717) from Google Reader, my \[delicious bookmarks\](http://delicious.com/cpjobling) and some of \[my photos\](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/) on Flickr. I even have some module related blogs in Blackboard for some of the courses that I teach. So is this all too much? Am I spreading myself too thin?

I have dabbled with various ways to aggregate all these strands of my life on line. For example, I have created a \[Swurl page\](http://cpjobling.swurl.com/), a \[FriendFeed\](http://friendfeed.com/cpjobling), a \[Tumblr blog\](http://cpjobling.tumblr.com/) and a \[Netvibes public page\](http://www.netvibes.com/crispyj#Latest). I even have a \[Yahoo! Pipe\](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?\_id=Wnwc21Am3BGdl8vPBx2yXQ) which aggregates some (but not all) of these and generates an RSS feed!

So which is the real me? Which should you follow?
