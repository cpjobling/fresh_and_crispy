So I subscribed to posterous.com (just by sending an email to [post at posterous.com](mailto:post@posterous.com)) and now I can post to the Learning Lab Community blog, Fresh and Crispy, Twitter and Flickr all at the same time … by email!  
   
And as I’m doing this at 12.42 am, I’ve obviously got a bad case of  
social network addiction.  
   
Must stop signing up!
