In honour of “[Lady Lovelace Day](http://ada.pint.org.uk/)” I had pledged to write a post on computing pioneer [Rear Admiral Grace Hopper](http://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/hopper.html "Biography."), one of first programmers of the [Harvard Mark I Calculator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I "Read more about the Harvard Mark I Calculator.") and designers of the [Cobol programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol "More about Cobol."). Grace is always remembered for finding a [real bug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug) in one of her computer programs (in the days when computers were made with thermionic valves and relays) and taped it into her [log book](http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h96000/h96566kc.htm "Photo of the actual log book page, from the Online Library of Selected Images, Naval Historical Centre") along with the wry comment:

> “\[time\] 15.45 Relay #70, Panel F (moth) in Relay. First actual case of bug being found.”

p>As luck would have it, as I sat down to type this post, I found this video interview from 2 October 1986 on YouTube which adds some additional interest to this post.

What a wonderful, warm and funny woman!
