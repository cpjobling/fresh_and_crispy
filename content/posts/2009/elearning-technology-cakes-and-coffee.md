Today I attended a pleasant hour at e-learning and cakes. Saw a demo of [QR codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) and [Paper Show](http://www.papershow.com/en/index.asp) two technologies that have real potential (although I will have to think more about how to use the former than the latter). If nothing else, QR-codes may convince me to actually try the mobile internet!

(A nice side affect of using the mobile internet is that I might be able to use [TwitPic](http://twitpic.com/) to get my photos off my phone!)
