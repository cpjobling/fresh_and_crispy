Swurl was a lifestreaming tool with a great interface that I was subscribed to since I read about it in [Read Write Web](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/swurl_your_lifestream_made_bea.php) back in July last year. Unfortunately, without warning, it’s now gone and taken my life with it! All that is left is the apologetic note illustrated.

Luckily I still have my [friend-feed](http://friendfeed.com/cpjobling?start=30), [tumblr blog](http://cpjobling.tumblr.com/) and [netvibes home page](http://www.netvibes.com/crispyj#Latest).

Moral: don’t get too attached to a single Web 2.0 service! In the current economic climate, there’ll be a few that fall by the wayside.
