[![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03d10-windows-7-on-a-mac.png?w=300)](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03d10-windows-7-on-a-mac.png)This is a screen-grab from my new MacBook Pro and it’s running Windows 7 in a OS/X window. It’s not magic, it’s the free open-source VirtualBox virtualizer from Sun Microsystems. At less than half the price of Parallels!

It works. It took no time to set up. And it means that I can continue to run some of the essential windows-only software (such as Camtasia Studio), Windows Live Writer, etc, during my transition from PC pragmatist to Mac Zealot.

If the upgrade of my 2-year-old Dell office desktop to Windows 7 from Vista is anywhere near as smooth, I’ll be very surprised! For more on running Windows 7 on VirtualBox on the Mac, these “\[Fat Bloke’s Shorts\](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBoxTV)” videos from VirtualBox TV are a great introduction.
