I have noticed that a few people in my Friendfeed have been using a new (to me) social commenting service [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/) to mediate their blog comments. Unable to resist trying out “yet another Web2.0 service” (YAWTS), I’ve signed up. After some adjustment to my Blogger template to include the necessary third-party code, my comments are now using Disqus and you can subscribe to a post’s comment stream, or all my comments. Should be a nice way to monitor comments on my posts if nothing else!

Why not try it yourself: it has some of the features that your Blogger comments engine is missing such as threaded comments, cross-social network links and reblogging. I just hope that it doesn’t [go the way of Swurl](http://cpjobling.swurl.com/)!
