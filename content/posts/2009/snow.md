According to the \[BBC\](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7865378.stm "BBC Snow!"), snow falls today caused major \[disruption\](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7864315.stm "BBC: London Travel Severely disrupted") to normal sevice of \[UK PLC\](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7864804.stm "BBC: Businesses counting the cost"). In Swansea, we had a light dusting as this shot of my route into work shows. Light snow showers expected tonight.
