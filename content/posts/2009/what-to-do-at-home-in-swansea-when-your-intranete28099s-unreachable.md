While working at home I wondered why I couldn’t connect to the new [Plagiarism Awareness](http://moodle.rsc-wales.ac.uk/plagiarism/) site recently announced by RSC Wales. Later I decided I’d do some work on Blackboard and found that I couldn’t connect. Odd, I thought!

So I did a ping/traceroute and discovered that the Swansea.ac.uk domain is cut-off from the Internet (see Twitpic image below).

[![Looks like Swansea is cut off from the Internet at the moment! Twitpic](http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/jxpro.png)](http://twitpic.com/jxpro "Looks like Swansea is cut off from the Internet at the moment! on Twitpic")

My only choice is to walk in to work!

**A couple of minutes later**  
The blockage spontaneously removed itself and comparing traceroute traces, it looks like one of Virgin Media’s local routers failed rather than anything on campus.

Still, I should go to work anyway!
