I found this fascinating quote today. Regarding TurnitIn:

> Recycling and repurposing of text online is becoming so ubquituous that the noise is casuing a problem in the interpretation of originality reports. They used to save us time in investigating cases of plagiarism, now Iâ€™m not so sure.Nick Sharratt, [DrBadgr](http://drbadgr.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/thoughts-on-turnitins-database/), Nov 2009

As we are about to use TurnitIn for dissertation theses, this arrives as a timely warning!
