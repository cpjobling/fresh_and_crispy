I am grateful to my friend and former Swansea colleague Dr Farzin Deravi of University of Kent at Canterbury who read my blog post on Euler’s identity (“[The Most Beautiful Equation in the World](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2009/02/most-beautiful-equation-in-world.html)”) via Facebook and told me about this video proof of the equation:

It’s well put together, but for me crucially omits the vital step that substitutes cos ? = -1 and sin ? = 0 to reduce e_i_? = cos ? – _i_ sin ? to e_i_? = –1 + 0 which of course can be rearranged to give e_i_? + 1 = 0.

This was not the only “Euler Video” available on YouTube, looking further, I found this [nice example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zELiwFCQa1Y&NR=1 "Another proof of Euler's Identity. This one using screen recording of a tablet input."), also a proof of Euler’s identity, that shows what you can do with a tablet and screen recording software.

Two very inspirational demonstrations of the power of video in the teaching of mathematical concepts.
