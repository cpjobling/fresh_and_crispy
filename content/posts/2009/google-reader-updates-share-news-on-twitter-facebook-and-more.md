As reported in Mashable [Google Reader Updates: Share News on Twitter, Facebook, and More](http://mashable.com/2009/08/12/google-reader-send-to/) is a feature that Iâ€™ve wanted in Google Reader for ever! Now you can have a send-to link in your Reader Page and send items you want to share to Blogger, Twitter, Facebook, delicious etc. Greeeaaaat!
