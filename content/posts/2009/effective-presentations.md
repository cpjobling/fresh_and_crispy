This new Flowgram weaves the best of the Internet’s sites on presentations into a briefing presentation for my research project students. At the time of writing, there is no soundtrack but check back later. **Important note**, Flowgram goes off line on 30th June: you probably won’t see the embedded presentation after that date.

Flowgram has been playing up lately: it takes an inordinate amount of time between uploading PowerPoint slides and them appearing on the site. Hopefully it’s just a temporary glitch but I’ve had to embed the web sites into the actual PowerPoint files to get this to work in my live briefings!
