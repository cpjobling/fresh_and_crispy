I was a twitter use for many years and you'll find the archeological remains of my twitter use in the blog by the broken embedded tweets that remain.

After Elon Musk took over twitter, I decided to leave and I closed down my first account. I still have an archive at [cpjobling.github.io/cpjobling-tweets](https://cpjobling.github.io/cpjobling-tweets). I had a skeleton presence for some time, but that closed too a few months ago.

Now, I've gone over to Bluesky ([bsky.app](https://bsky.app)) where I can be found as @[cpjobling.bluesky.social](https://cpjobling.bluesky.social). The recent support from Musk for the riots and against the prime minister, and worsening atmosphere as "free speech" turns toxic, is encouraging other long-time twitter users to make the move.

Perhaps my old friends will move over too. I look forward to seeing you.
