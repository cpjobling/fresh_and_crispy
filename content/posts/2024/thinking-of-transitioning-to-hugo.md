[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static web generator written in Go. I’m thinking of exporting this WordPress site to Hugo so that all the posts, pages and assets are text, easily version controlled and ready for writing as I transition from academia to private life.

I’ll keep notes on the process and post them in the new Hugo site.
