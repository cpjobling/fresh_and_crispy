Today, I’ve been mostly watching Google videos! Aside from the previously blogged video on the [death of the desktop](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/05/away-with-applications-death-of-desktop.html) I’ve also watched [Brion Vibber’s Google Tech Talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407) on [Wikipedia](http://www.blogger.com/en.wikipedia.org) and the [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) software that drives it. Also from Google Video was this [Documentary on Open Source available on Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7707585592627775409):

\> “Revolution OS is a 2001 documentary which traces the history of GNU, Linux, and the open source and free software movements. It features several interviews with prominent hackers and entrepreneurs (and hackers-cum-entrepreneurs), including Richard Stallman, Michael Tiemann, Linus Torvalds, Larry Augustin, Eric S. Raymond, Bruce Perens, Frank Hecker and Brian Behlendorf.” Here’s the video: [http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=7707585592627775409&hl=en](http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=7707585592627775409&hl=en) In my copious remaining free time, I have also added a links and a few new pages to the \[Swansea Learning Lab Resources Wiki\](http://learninglab.swan.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php), and listened to Part 1 of the \[JavaOne retrospective podcast\](http://javaposse.com/index.php?post\_id=215987), the first of two special podcasts from the \[Java Posse\](http://javaposse.com/).
