While reading Robert C. (Uncle Bob) Martin’s “UML for Java Programmers” \[Prentice Hall, 2003\] I came accross a reference to “Fitnesse” a wiki-based acceptance testing system. Looks very interesting and well worth a deeper look. I added Uncle Bob’s blog feed to Blogger.com (see my Blogroll) to track other interesting bits and bobs (pun unintended).
