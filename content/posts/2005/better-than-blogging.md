I saw an article on this “coomunity bookmarking” site some time ago (in Thursday Guardian OnLine supplement I think) and signed up. Didn’t quite get it at the time, but today I read another [Guardian OnLine article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,,1444090,00.html) and I saw Jon Udell’s [screencast](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/03/14.html#a1194). Now I think I start to understand. It’s a better way to do the kind of “link blogging” that I want to do when I haven’t got the time to write a more detailed entry. It’s very similar and probably more powerful than the “clip this” feature in Bloglines. I’ve been creating delicious bookmarks for the last couple of hours and eally enjoying myself. So much so that my RSS feed ([http://del.icio.us/cpjobling](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling) is now on my blogroll.
