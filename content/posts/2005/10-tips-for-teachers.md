I have quietly admired Kathy Sierra’s approach to teaching for some time now and own all the [_Head First books_](http://headfirst.oreilly.com/) (including the 2nd Edition of Head First Java). Kathy and her colleagues launched a Web Log [_Creating Passionate Users_](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/) in [December](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2004/12/how_well_do_you.html) of last year. Today’s article [Ten Tips for New Trainers/Teachers](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/07/ten_tips_for_ne.html) might be a good lauch point for me to learn about and apply some of these ideas in my own teaching. It’s all rather opportune as I’m just starting out on a new course called “Web Applications Technology” and the first lecture (old style) is already written.
