I have played with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) on and off for a while but as documentation is a bit patchy, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the [“Maven Book”](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mavenadn/index.html) by Vincent Massol and Tim O’Brien’s (_Maven: A Developer’s Notebook_, O’Reilly, 2005) since it was [announced](http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/vmassol/archives/001003_maven_book_and_maven_quiz.html) some time ago. It’s been on pre-order at Amazon.co.uk for months but it finally arrived yesterday. I worked through chapter 1 in about two hours. Chapter 3 looks particularly interesting. The books comes with some interesting extras such as

*   The Maven Book Wiki [www.mavenbook.org](http://www.mavenbook.org/)
    
*   Subversion repository for the code [www.mavenbook.org/svn/mdn/code](http://www.mavenbook.org/svn/mdn/code)

p>If you’re intrigued, there’s a copy of Chapter 1: Maven Jump Start [online](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mavenadn/chapter/index.html). My only concern is how much of the book will still be valid when [Maven 2](http://maven.apache.org/maven2/index.html) finally gets out of beta.
