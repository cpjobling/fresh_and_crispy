There’s some weird and wonderful stuff out there. Here was map I created at [http://www.world66.com/myworld66](http://www.world66.com/myworld66) of the places I’ve visited in the world so far (site and image both gone from the internet!) It was a little misleading because I’ve only been to Georgia, Florida, Arizona and California in the States and New South Wales (well actually only Sydney) in Australia. Still, it’s a bit of a giggle.
