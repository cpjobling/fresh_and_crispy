I’ve just completed a couple of lab report marking sessions and saw the usual mistakes being made. By the usual process of serendipity I noted [Writing Between the Lines](http://www.toolshed.com/blog/Writing/between-the-lines.html,v) from Andy Hunt (pragmatic programmer) which is well worth directing my students to. Here’s a nice pithy quote that I could see myself adding to the red-ink comments that I typically add to a returned report:

> Remember that writing is a conversation. \[…\] Explain it to me like I’m sitting right here with a confused look on my face. Odds are that I am.
