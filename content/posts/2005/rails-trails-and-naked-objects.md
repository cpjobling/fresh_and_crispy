Been watching presentations and demonstrations of Rails and Trails. Bookmarks online [http://del.icio.us/cpjobling](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling). Rails is a rapid web application development framework that makes developing CRUD interfaces a snap. It is based on the Active Record pattern, is written in Ruby and has a set of smart classes that automates initial view generation and the controller. By default, the model is essentially an active record. Trails is a Java framework inspired by Rails that leverages Hibernate, Tapestry and Spring to provide similar functionality. The whole thing has some synergy with Naked Objects. Could be a good basis for EG-358 and thereâ€™s a nice little spring-break project here I think.
