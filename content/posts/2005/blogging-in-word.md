Blogger has just launched a new plug-in for Word that allows you to write your Blog articles in Word and upload it. _All \*the \*_usual \*\*stuff that you’d expect. Tables and images are not supported.  
  
You’ll find the download page at [http://buzz.blogger.com/bloggerforword.html](http://buzz.blogger.com/bloggerforword.html).
