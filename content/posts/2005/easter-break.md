Here in the UK, Universities typically send students off on holiday for the four weeks around the period in March-April when Easter falls. At the University of Wales Swansea (or [Swansea University](http://www.swansea.ac.uk/) as it prefers to call itself \[for marketing purposes)\]) our Easter break is right in the middle of the teaching period. There are still three weeks of lecturing to go after Easter, and quite a lot of course preparation, marking, exam setting, course reviews and other admin stuff, but nonetheless it’s still a period for taking a breather, catching up on interesting stuff and adding stuff to this Blog. I started a day or two early having discovered via a Blog entry (forget whose, sorry!) that JavaLobby.com had recorded most of the presentations from last year’s [JavaPolis conference](http://www.javalobby.org/av/javapolis/index.jsp) keynotes, presentations and demos and made them available free and on demand with a streaming audio soundtrack. There’s lots to keep me entertained.

Already I’ve watched:

*   Dion Almaer and James Strachan’s “Pragmatic Groovy” presentation which is very relevant as I stole great chunks of this very PowerPoint presentation (which you’ll find [on-line](http://docs.codehaus.org/download/attachments/2715/JavaPolisGroovy.ppt?version=1) in the articles collection at [groovy.codehaus.org/Articles](http://www.blogger.com/groovy.codehaus.org/Articles)) and used them in a set of lectures on Groovy which I’ve just completed in the “introduction to scripting languages” part of my Software Applications course.
*   Vincent Massol’s presentation and demo of Maven. Also highly relevant as I used Maven to create the project web site for this year’s [Software Applications Project](http://eehope.swan.ac.uk/%7Eeechris/Courses/EG-358/Project/). And it’s really great (if only I could get ViewCVS to show me the repository!).

I also started to watch Erich Gamma’s presentation on Eclipse and am about to watch Tim Bray’s keynote on dynamic languages for Java. Check back for more!
