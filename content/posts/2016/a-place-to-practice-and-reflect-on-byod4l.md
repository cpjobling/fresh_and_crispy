The fourth iteration of the short course [Bring Your Own Devices for Learning (#BYOD4L)](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/) started today and as this will be my third iteration, I have decided to volunteer as a participant and mentor. The course is hosted on Wordpress at [byod4l.wordpress.com](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/) and it can also be followed by watching hashtag [#byod4l](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23byod4l) on Twitter and other social networks. You can also contribute by joining the [BYOD4Learning Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115166756393440336480) pages on Google+.

As for my personal plans, I am planning to use a **OneNote Class Notebook** ([link](https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook)) with at least one of my classes this semester. Therefore, as a way of learning the features of OneNote myself, particularly in the context of [Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device), I decided to use it as a place to publish my reflections and to share it with the whole community.
