This blog was self-hosted on digital ocean until today. 

Unfortunately, issues with the database was preventing the blog appearing for some of my readers and I don't have time at the moment to be a Sysadmin and trace the fault. Rebooting the server when I notice it's down is not a solution either. So, I've forked out the £30 a year to have a site with a custom domain hosted on Wordpress.com.  And here it is.

Excuse us while we move all our content and sharing options over.
