I attended the HEA STEM Conference in Nottingham last week and I am preparing records of the tweet stream using [@storify](https://storify.com). Here's the first episode which covers the end of the joint [#HEAchat](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/about/blog/heachat) and [#LTHEchat](http://lthechat.com) on [tweeting at conferences](http://lthechat.com/2016/01/25/lthechat-no-44-with-prof-simon-lancaster-sue-beckingham/) to the end of Day one on Thursday 28th January.

Here's the [story of Day 1](https://storify.com/cpjobling/hea-stem-conference-day-1).
