On Friday I stumbled across #GuildChat which was discussing the Learning Management System (LMS) or what we in the UK call the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).

As a long-time participant in Wednesday's [#LTHEchat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LTHEchat) ([@LTHEchat](https://twitter.com/LTHEchat)) I expected the chat to be "storified", but as it wasn't, I've taken the liberty of making my own record. Here it is.

About #GuildChat and #LTHEchat
------------------------------

[#GuildChat](https://twitter.com/GuildChat) is a weekly Tweet Chat hosted by the [eLearning Guild](http://www.elearningguild.com/) ([@eLearningGuild](http://twitter.com/eLearningGuild))-- a US membership organization that seems similar to the UK's [Association for Learning Technology](https://www.alt.ac.uk/) ([@A\_L\_T](https://twitter.com/A_L_T)).

#GuildChat takes place every Friday at 2:00 pm EST (7:00 PM BST).

#LTHEchat takes place on Wednesdays (during term time) at 8:00 PM BST. More information is to be found at [LTHE.com](http://lthchat.com).

What's a Tweet Chat?
--------------------

Tweet chats are an excellent way to build a professional network and to engage in "bitesize" Continuing Professional Development (CPD). For more information on the benefits of and how to participate in a tweet chat, I recommend [Introducing Tweet Chats](https://socialmediaforlearning.com/2014/10/16/introducing-tweet-chats/) by #LTHEchat co-founder and colleague Sue Beckingham ([@suebecks](https://twitter.com/suebecks)).
