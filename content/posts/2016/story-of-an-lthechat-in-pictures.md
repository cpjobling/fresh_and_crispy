As part of our preparation for [our presentation](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/16-with-a-little-help-from-my-followers-facilitating-the-lthechat/?doing_wp_cron=1478262873.8662788867950439453125) for [Social Media in Higher Education](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/) in December (#SocMedHE16), the team is looking at various ways to assess the impact of the weekly [#LTHEchat](https://lthechat.com/). As part of this, I agreed to attempt to record a flavour of the excitement of the event by capturing snapshots of the growth of the network over a twenty-four hour period using Martin Hawksey's [TAGSExplorer](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2011/10/tagsexplorer-intro/) which generated [this visualisation](http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/?key=10IA2lGIy8uOp-MEPhmpJ1rY36cE6Hz04OLWOKMdK2FU&sheet=Archive), and [Jing](https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html).

I created a _storify_ of the tweets and some of the reaction:

We should definitely reflect on Richard Treves' comments that appear at the end of the story:

R they just cool? [https://t.co/2VQSaHfupx](https://t.co/2VQSaHfupx)
