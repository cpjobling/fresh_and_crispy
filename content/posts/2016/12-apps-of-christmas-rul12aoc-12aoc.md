![img_1030](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_1030.png) It's the first of December and in the Learning Technology world this means the launch of multiple open courses promising to introduce busy academics to **12 Apps of Christmas**.

I'm enrolled on the Regent's University of London course which is being hosted on the [Blackboard Open Courses platform](https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_811_1).

I'm recommending **12 Apps of Christmas** to my colleagues for two reasons. Firstly because it provides useful introductions to mobile apps that they can use with students. But perhaps as important, Blackboard Learn is Swansea University's VLE so taking part will give my colleagues an insight into what it's like to be a student on a Blackboard Learn course.

This year, the organizers are also encouraging us to use the [Blackboard Student App](http://www.blackboard.com/mobile-learning/bbstudent.aspx). This makes the course more accessible - for example I hope to use the app to follow each day's recommendation while on my daily commute. But in addition, exploring the features and limitations of the app will give valuable insight into what you can and _cannot_ do well when presenting your Blackboard course content on a small mobile device.

\[…\] of my first findings while looking at the first app of 12 apps for Christmas is that the content viewer in the BB Student App doesn’t display Blackboard Learn’s own \[…\]
