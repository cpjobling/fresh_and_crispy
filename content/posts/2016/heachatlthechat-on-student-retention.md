This Wednesday's #LTHEChat was the first of this new semester's joint monthly get togethers with the Higher Education Academy (HEA). The topic was [connection for student retention](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/blog/connection-retention-building-effective-learning-relationships) (or [student resilience](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/09/26/how-improve-student-persistence-and-completion-essay) as Vincent Tinto prefers to call "retention" which he regards as an institutionally focused word). As usual there was a lot of useful sharing. Here's the Storify: [Connection for Retention- building effective learning relationships](https://storify.com/cuthbert_kate/connection-for-retention).
