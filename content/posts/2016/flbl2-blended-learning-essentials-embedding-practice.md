I attended the first run of FutureLearn MOOC [#FLble1 Blended Learning Essentials: Getting Started](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-getting-started) last year. Because of other commitments, I couldn't take part in the first run of the second part [#FLble2 Blended Learning Essentials: Embedding Practice](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-embedding-practice) but it looks like I have another chance in the re-run that starts 3 October.

Highly recommended!

If you missed it, the team leaders Diana Laurillard and Neil Morris [gave a talk on the Blended Learning Essentials courses on Future Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4ZqYJbyXn0) at the 2016 Alt Conference.
