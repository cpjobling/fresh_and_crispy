James has also blogged about this in [I know Where You Are](http://elearningstuff.net/2016/10/31/i-know-where-you-are-2/) and is following up in this JISC blog post "[What does the imminent arrival of the intelligent campus mean for you and your students.](https://intelligentcampus.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2016/10/31/what-does-the-imminent-arrival-of-the-intelligent-campus-mean-for-universities-and-colleges/)"

What do you think?

James has published more of the discussion of the intelligent campus from #codesign16 in [this storyfy](https://storify.com/jamesclay/intelligent-campus-tweetchat).
