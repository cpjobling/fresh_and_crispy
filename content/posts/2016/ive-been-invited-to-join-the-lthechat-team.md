My first job will be to create the Storify for [LTHEchat 45](http://lthechat.com/2016/02/08/lthechat-no-45-julie-tardy-jtardy81-integrating-complexity-in-curriculum-designs-integrer-la-notion-de-complexite-dans-le-curriculum/) (the first bilingual LTHEchat) which has guest facilitator Julie Tardy ([@jtardy81](https://twitter.com/jtardy81)). It takes place at 8:00 pm GMT on Wednesday 10th February. Looking forward to it.

If you want to join me, these instructions may be helpful.
