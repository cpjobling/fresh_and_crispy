![Bring Your Own Device for Learning Hashtag](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-12-09_1342.png?w=204)Back in January for its fifth run is the excellent [Bring Your Own Device for Learning (#BYOD4L)](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/) online CPD-fest. Covering the 5Cs, Connecting, Communicating, Curating, Collaborating and Creating, this "course" aims to share great ideas and build communities. Concentrating on portable educational technology that you can use with yourself, your colleagues and your students, you're guaranteed to discover something that will enable you and them to be more effective. And at the same time you'll find yourself becoming part of a growing community of like-minded souls.

I've participated three times already and it's a really rewarding if hectic 5 days. This year's facilitators will be Sheila MacNeil (@[sheilamcn](https://twitter.com/sheilmcn), Alex Spiers (@[alexgspiers](https://twitter.com/alexspiers)and Neil Withnell (@[neilwithnell](https://twitter.com/neilwithnell) and they introduced the course by web-cast during yesterday's [final day of the ALT Winter Conference](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2016/#/day3). You can find out more and a recording of the web-cast here: [#BYOD4L V – this time it’s personal](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2016/sessions/byod4l-v-this-time-its-personal-98/).

The community has been invited to contribute so expect to see me there.
