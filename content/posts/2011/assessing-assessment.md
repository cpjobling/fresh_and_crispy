As noted in [Innovating e-Learning 2011 : JISC](http://blog.cpjobling.me/2011/11/08/innovating-e-learning-2011-jisc/ "Innovating e-Learning 2011 : JISC") and [Poacher turned gamekeeper](http://blog.cpjobling.me/2011/11/18/poacher-turned-gamekeeper/ "Poacher turned gamekeeper") I am attending the Innovating E-Learning Online Conference during the gaps in my full calendar. Today there was a quite large gap between the morning session (on Work-based Learning) and the final plenary session on _Theme 1: Learning Landscapes_ and I was able to fill in a locally arrange Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching (SALT) seminar lunchtime seminar on **Multiple Choice: The smart choice or dumbing down**?

During this session we learned about a local HEA funded project that is looking at the value of single selection versus elimination-style multiple choice questions in the life sciences and this was followed by an excellent presentation from Steve Draper of Glasgow University called [Improving deep learning with Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Electronic Voting Systems (EVS)](http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/talks/evs8.html "http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/talks/evs8.html").

Following on, as it did quite by chance, from an excellent Activity-Week introduction to [PeerWise](http://peerwise.cs.auckland.ac.nz/ "PeerWise supports students in the creation, sharing, evaluation and discussion of assessment questions. ") (mentioned in Steveâ€™s talk) and conference sessions on Assessment and Feedback and Students as Agents of Change (at which EVS came highly recommended by students in the Business School at Exeter), I feel justified in struggling with computer-based assessment and eager to try some of the new-to-me techniques mentioned by Steve and my colleagues from life sciences here at Swansea.

Having been excused from a staff-student committee by my Head of Teaching in order to attend this session, I hope that I will also be able to pass back the message that MCQs and EVSs are legitimate and powerful learning tools when used correctly.
