Back in November, member of my social network Alan Cann asked me to participate in a project he was doing with the [International Centre for Guidance Studies](http://www.derby.ac.uk/icegs) for the [Research Information Network](http://www.rin.ac.uk/) on Social Media for researchers.

A few days later, I met online in Skype Chat with researcher Konstantia Dimitrou and we discussed my attitudes to social networking and its use in my teaching and scholarship. The report [Social Media: A Guide for Researchers](http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/social-media-guide-researchers) has now been released and you can read part of what I had to say on page 38 and in full on the Web at [http://www.rin.ac.uk/node/1015](http://www.rin.ac.uk/node/1015).

The report itself is well worth a look, particularly if you think research should be done the way it has always been done. Social media may be a way to raise your REF **impact** numbers if nothing else.
