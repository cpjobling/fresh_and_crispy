Just read Stephen Downes’ article on the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-downes/connectivism-and-connecti_b_804653.html) that announces that registration for [Connectivsm and Connective Knowledge 2011](http://cck11.mooc.ca/) (cck11) — starting 17th January — is open. I definitely won’t have the personal resource to do much there, but it’ll be interesting nonetheless.
