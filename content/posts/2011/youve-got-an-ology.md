Zaid Ali Alsagoff shared his discovery of [schoology.com](https://www.schoology.com/home.php) at last week’s Wednesday presentation on #CCK11 so I’ve posted the link in a blog post [“You’ve got an “Ology”?](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/2011/03/youve-got-ology.html) on the [Swansea Learning Lab](http://llcommunity.blogspot.com/) community blog. We also discussed lecture capture at a pan-Wales meeting today, and I included a postscript about the CCK11 model of meeting capture with Elluminate.

Brits of a certain age, will need no explanation for the title of this post. By way of explanation, for my younger and oversees readers, I include this video, a classic TV ad starring Maureen Lipmann, from before British Telecom became BT,
