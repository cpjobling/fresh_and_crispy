I’ve just installed the new TweetdDeck app for Google Chrome and like what I see so far. It takes the “**_that’s so obvious, why wasn’t it done before_**” idea of combining (TweetDeck calls this _blending_) all your feeds into three columns.

*   _Home_: for all your identities and the people they follow across all of your social networks;
*   _Me_: for mentions of your social identities and posts to your facebook newsfeeds; and
*   Inbox: for direct messages.

Like TweetDeck the desktop app, you can add your Twitter, Facebook and Google Buzz accounts and you can post to one or all of them.

I hope that the iPhone version will adopt this interface as it’s much easier to handle the blended columns than multiple columns on the small screen.

It’s only been 5 minutes, but first impressions: 5 thumbs up!
