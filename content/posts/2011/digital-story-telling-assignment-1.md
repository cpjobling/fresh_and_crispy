As part of the first week’s assignment we’ve been asked to [set up our own webhost and domain](http://ds106.us/2011/01/12/domain-and-webhosting/). I’ve registered a new domain _cpjobling.me_ with [Godaddy.com](http://godaddy.com/) and a signed up for the minimum hosting package from [cast iron coding](https://support.castironcoding.com/) (CIC). I’m waiting for my confirmations to come through, then I’ll be setting up my name servers using the instructions provided [here](http://digitalstorytelling.umwblogs.org/2010/01/16/pointing-your-domain-to-your-web-hosting/) and WordPress blog using the instructions given [here](http://digitalstorytelling.umwblogs.org/2010/01/16/setting-up-a-blog-using-fantastico-deluxe/). Everything went fine and now I have a new Word Press blog which may one-day replace this one: [blog.cpjobling.me](http://blog.cpjobling.me/).

I could (and have) done this manually on my own server, but the experience of using a hosting service and domain registration provides some good experience.
