*   [Doceri Remote – The Interactive Whiteboard for the iPad – iPads in Education](http://ipadeducators.ning.com/profiles/blogs/doceri-remote-the-interactive?xg_source=activity)

Wow! You have got to try Doceri Remote for the iPad and Doceri Desktop for the PC/Mac. This app has one feature that I have not found on any other desktop remote. It allows you to annotate on anything. Basically, your iPad, PC/Mac and Projector becomes your digital smart board. There is no need to pay for expensive and bulky smart board systems. Nor any of the wireless pen based whiteboards. Doceri is all you need. Doceri gives you the freedom to teach from anywhere in the classroom. You can annotate, open and close programs, surf the web, play flash video, control and annotate on your power points wirelessly from your iPad. It even allows you to record your annotations and play them back. For more information please visit Doceri.
