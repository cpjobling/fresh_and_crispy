It’s that time of year again. I just signed up for the [Innovating e-Learning 2011 : JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningpedagogy/elpconference11.aspx) online conference subtitled “Learning in Transition”. Is anyone I know going to be attending? If there’s anyone at Swansea Um shall we try to arrange a group viewing of one or more of the keynotes?
