Those of you who are regular readers will know that I spent 10 weeks from September to November immersed (almost literally) in the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Personal Learning Environments, Networks and Knowledge (PLENK2010). As [already reported](http://blog.cpjobling.org/2010/11/socratic-questioning-week-7-in.html), one of the highlights for me was the guest appearance of Maria Andersen and her intriguing proposal for developing SOCRAIT, a Socratic questioning layer on the internet consisting of a _Learn This_ button, a social gaming-like motivation and reward system, and channeled expertise designed to provide a personalized learning for the masses. A disruptive technology indeed!

Well, a pre-print of Maria’s paper _The World is My School_, due to appear in the January-February 2011 issue of [_The Futurist_](http://www.wfs.org/futurist), has just been posted ([http://bit.ly/socraitpdf](http://bit.ly/socraitpdf)) and Maria is looking to spread the word virally using the twitter hashtag [#SOCRAIT](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23socrait).

I invite you to read Maria’s paper and use the comments to answer these questions:

*   Could a system like SOCRAIT work?
*   Would you use it?
*   How would _you_ implement it?
*   Could you see yourself using it in your own learning?
*   Could you adopt it in your teaching?
*   Would it be disruptive?

I’m pretty certain that if someone builds SOCRAIT, I will use it.
