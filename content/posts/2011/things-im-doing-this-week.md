1.  Learning about Moodle with the help of a [couple](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1849515263) of [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Moodle-2-0-First-Look-Cooch/dp/1849511942/ref=pd_sim_b_2) and a [lynda.com](http://lynda.com) [training course](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1596715553) (which is really rather good!)
2.  Watching the recordings of [Moodle Moot UK 2011](http://mootuk11.org.uk/) on YouTube (tag [mootuk11](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MOOTUK11&search=tag))
3.  Signing up for the [2011 JISC Innovating e-Learning](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/elpconference11) online 2011 conference
4.  Thinking about [Non-Barking Dogs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pd5hCgUwoc)
5.  Re-evaluating [Ning](http://elesig.ning.com/) (Elesig) and [Cloudworks](http://cloudworks.ac.uk/)

And looking forward to migrating some of my Blackboard courses to Moodle.

I have also just downloaded an e-copy of [Rethinking Learning for a Digital Age](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003TXRVLG/ref=docs-os-doi_0) and will be reading it over coffee.
