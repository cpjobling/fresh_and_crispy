I’m planning to move [Fresh and Crispy](http://blog.cpjobling.org)y to this blog on the 1st March 2011. Consider this an early warning. [Inspired by Jim Groom’s Digital Story Telling Course](/?post=3) (DS106), I purchased this domain and it hosts my own WordPress blog.

I’ve already exported my posts from Blogger.com and moved my disqus.com discussion threads over. Now it only remains to cut the cord.

Until the cut-off point, I’ll be blogging in both places in parallel. After the 1st March, I’ll be posting only over here. I’ll keep the domain [blog.cpjobling.org](http://blog.cpjobling.org/) active as a historical record, at least until the domain comes up for renewal in a year’s time.

My thanks to blogger.com for 7 years stirling service.
