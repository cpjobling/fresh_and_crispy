I’ve just joined the Evaluation of Learners’ Experiences of e-learning Special Interest Group (ELESIG) which is based around a Ning site ([elesig.ning.com](http://elesig.ning.com/)).  After Chris Hall and David Williams launched a _Gwella_ group, I’ve noticed an increase in activity and the community that is developing looks to be quite exciting.

Was I wrong to reject Ning when they removed free access?

Should we have stuck with Ning for SALT and the Learning Lab?
