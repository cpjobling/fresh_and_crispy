I’ve just imported my posts from [Fresh and Crispy](http://blog.cpjobling.org "Fresh and Cripsy") on Blogspot using the WordPress Blogger blogs importer tool. Seems to have worked fine, but the comments in disqus.com where not carried over. I wonder if i) disqus.com can be used to manage comments in WordPress ii) If not, can comments be exported? In any case, I’m not yet ready to cut the cord!

Answers i) Yes there’s a disqus plugin for wordpress and there’s a domain transfer tool. So that’s OK!
