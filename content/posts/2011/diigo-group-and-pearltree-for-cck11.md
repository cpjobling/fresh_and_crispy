A couple of small things:  I’ve created an open public Diigo group for Connectivism and Connected Knowledge 2011 which you can use to share useful bookmarks ([http://groups.diigo.com/group/cck\_2011](http://groups.diigo.com/group/cck_2011)) and a team Pearltree ([http://pear.ly/JgB5](http://pear.ly/JgB5)). I won’t have much time to contribute to CCK11, but I’m hoping that my network will help me by curating the must see resources that I might not have time to do for myself.

As Karen Stephenson (cited in Siemens 2005) says:

> “Experience has long been considered the best teacher of knowledge. Since we cannot experience everything, other people’s experiences, and hence other people, become the surrogate for knowledge. ‘I store my knowledge in my friends’ is an axiom for collecting knowledge through collecting people (undated).”
