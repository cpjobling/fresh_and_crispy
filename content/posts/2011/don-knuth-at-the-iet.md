Don Knuth, another of my heroes, recently gave the 2011 Turing Lecture at the IET in Savoy Place using an interesting approach: “Ask me Anything!”. I wish I’d been there.

In London, Don was struggling with a cough but manfully answered all the questions. A week later, he r[epeated the performance at Machester](http://tv.theiet.org/technology/infopro/10267.cfm) and seems much more relaxed — not only in his dress. So there is clearly some benefit to being up north (if on the wrong side of the Pennines).
