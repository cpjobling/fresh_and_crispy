Just a quick post to remind you that [Fresh and Crispy](http://blog.cpjobling.org/) is moving to this self-hosted WordPress blog  [Fresh and Crispy II](http://blog.cpjobling.me/) ([blog.cpjobling.me](http://blog.cpjobling.me/)) on Monday 28th February.

Using the resources of Google, I’ve discovered a way to set up redirection so that regular visitors will hardly notice the move. (I’ll post a _how-to_ after the move.) Discussions have also been redirected.

However, if you are following me via RSS or Google Friend Connect you may have to make some adjustments. The new RSS feed link is [feeds2.feedburner.com/FreshAndCrispy2](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/FreshAndCrispy2). Google Friends Connect followers will need to follow me here (look for the gadget in the right-hand side bar).
