Iâ€™ve just launched a new blog called _[Crispy Development](http://dev.cpjobling.org.uk)_ in which I hope to document my various open-source projects that are hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/cpjobling). This is likely to be on the technical side, and is mostly to help me plan, document and remember stuff. But it may be of interest to someone.
