2011 apparently marks the 400th anniversary of the publication of the [King James Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorized_King_James_Version). To mark the occasion, the BBC made a bit of a splash last week with a sequence of three forty-five minute documentaries fronted by James Naughtie on the [commissioning](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x3qy7), [translation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x3x68) and [legacy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xln78) of the bible. These were followed by 7 hours of readings from the King James Bible made by the great and the good of the acting professions and introduced by well-known luminaries of literature and history.

For five days more, the whole lot is available from the special BBC [King James Bible site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xh4s3) and on the [iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xh4s3/episodes/player). You can also download the readings (in twenty minute chunks) as a [Podcast episodes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/kjbible) which you can download to keep forever.

I’m not religious, but this is nonetheless a great listen for lovers of English and History and the podcasts are a great resource.

Apparently there’ll also be a series of documentaries on BBC 4 soon.
