the point about coursera is the enormous publicity value...i think the report from the previous edcmooc said that most participants had heard about the course via coursera

Interesting question Chris. You might find one of the readings from next week useful as one perspective on this : Stewart, B., 2013. Massiveness + Openness = New Literacies of Participation? Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 9(2). http://jolt.merlot.org/vol9no2/stewart\_bonnie\_0613.htm There are some advantages to having a centralised space, but we also wanted to challenge that idea and show what other useful and interesting pedagogies might be able to take place on the open web. Of course 'open' is a contestable term. One might argue that the Coursera platform is less 'open' that other spaces, but aspects of the 'public' web also have constraints and limitations. I take the view that we are always compromised in the digital. The themes and topics of the EDCMOOC are also related directly to the web, so it seems appropriate to think about these issues while working and being 'in' spaces that reflect the distributed and disruptive nature of the digital, rather than the enclosed safety of the classroom.

I can see that the coursera branding might have this affect and it seems that last time around 60% of the students it was their first MOOC (this time it's not the case maybe - there appear to be lots serial MOOCers at least in Twitter). But once you've found the twitter hashtag and the resources list what's left for coursera to do? The conversations in the bulletin boards were too intellectual for me (and this isn't my first MOOC) so I left coursera almost immediately when I realised that other more accessible conversations were happening in the social networks.

What are the advantages of a centralized space? Cousera and its ilk seem to assume that it's the model to go for but the original distributed MOOCs promoted a more distributed approach. It's interesting that you've decided to do both. Perhaps coursera is needed only for the certification at the end of the process but monitoring what's happening must be a challenge when yo don't have control of the space that it's happening in.

I think the publicity value, as expressed below is definitely part of the reason. The ‘xMOOCs’ have attracted many more participants than the original ‘cMOOCs’. As the Stewart paper argues, a positive take on this would be to acknowledge that, at the very least, more exposure to online learning (and opportunities for engaging in digital literacy practices) must be a good thing. Part of our interesting in working with Coursera is to be critical of MOOCs, from an inside position. By critical, of course, I don’t mean negative. I mean that we can actively engage in both centralised AND distributed course spaces in order to get a sense of what works and what doesn’t. I don’t claim to know what MOOC pedagogy is, but being involved in teaching one might help me work towards that. I think the certification element is interesting, and we are certainly getting the sense that this is valued by a lot of students. However, there is also a lot of interest in centralised teaching, or ‘instruction’, and this is something that a centralised platform would seem to incorporate more readily.
