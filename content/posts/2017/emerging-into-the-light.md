I've decided to return to social media a bit earlier than planned. 

Here are two things that I thought I needed to share and brought me out if hibernation. For the first, I've been catching up on Bryan Alexander's discussions in his [Future Trends Forum](https://bryanalexander.org/the-future-trends-forum/) which can be viewed on this [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlcx8yl6hlPC3QjlbIHzxGqCP3qRa0zcg). I've been particularly interested in the discussion with Phil Hill on '[Towards the future Learning Msnsgement System](https://youtu.be/V53tHr8GyEY)' and '[The Future of Moodle](https://youtu.be/cTBJdwEWB5w)' with Martin Dougiamas. Both good flipped learning opportunities for anyone embarking on a VLE/LMS review. 

Secondly, Chris Rowell posted a proposal for the establishment of a [Digital Champions at Regent's University of London](https://totallyrewired.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/setting-up-a-digital-champions-scheme) which is an idea that my Univesity could usefully steal.
