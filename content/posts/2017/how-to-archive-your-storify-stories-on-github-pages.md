Yesterday, [Storify announced](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16767880/storify-shut-down-2-livefyre) the retirement of its [Storify](https://storify.com) service. This leaves a lot of users, including myself, with Storify stories linked into their blog sites and nowhere to host them when the service closes. Storify [has provided an export feature](https://storify.com/faq-eol), which can output a whole Storify store as a static HTML5 webpage, and GitHub provides a way to host static websites via its free [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature. I, therefore, yesterday tweeted about a proof of concept trial:

Today, I've created a simple video to show how it was done.

I'll be archiving my own collection of stories over the next few days and updating the links on this blog. To see my collection, visit [cpjobling.github.io/stories](https://cpjobling.github.io/stories).

This solves the problem for historical tweetchats. We, as a community, now need to find a new way to curate our future chats!
