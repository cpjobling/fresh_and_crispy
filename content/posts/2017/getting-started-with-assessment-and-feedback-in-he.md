On March first, Prof Sally Brown, recognised expert in Assessment and Feedback for HE, delivered a Webinar on [Getting Started with Assessment and Feedback](http://transformingassessment.com/events_1_march_2017.php) as part of the [Transforming Assessment series](http://transformingassessment.com/). The recording of the seminar, both as a Blackboard Collaborate session and on YouTube is now available and well worth watching as part of your CPD.

The [link to the seminar page](http://transformingassessment.com/events_1_march_2017.php) provides access to the  many resources for beginners in HE assessment mentioned in the Webinar. Sally Brown (twitter @[ProfSallyBrown](https://twitter.com/ProfSallyBrown)) and her partner Phil Race (@[RacePhil](https://twitter.com/RacePhil)) are both regulars at the weekly #[LTHEChat](https://lthechat.com/). Both they and the Transforming Assessment resources are well worth getting to know.
