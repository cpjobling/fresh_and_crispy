Inspired by friend and colleague Debbie Baff's "[Homeless blog posts](https://debbaffled.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/homeless-blog-posts/)", I've just had a look at my own Wordpress draft posts folder. I clearly had things that I wanted to say 3 months ago and I had a critique of HEA fellowship (still not resolved) a month ago. I also haven't posted anything that wasn't a tweet since March 2.

Perhaps we should all share our drafts (suitably redacted) from time to time, if only to spark us to get back on the blogging-bike.
