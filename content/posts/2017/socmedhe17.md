[![My co-presenters Sue Beckingham, Neil Withnell, Chris Rowell and Deb Baff at last year’s SocMedHE16](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_1070.jpg)](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/16-with-a-little-help-from-my-followers-facilitating-the-lthechat/)If the twitter hashtag (#[SocMedHe17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SocMedHE17)) I followed today was anything to go by, the 3rd Annual **Social Media in Higher Education** conference, held today at Sheffield Hallam University, was a great success.

I made a [twitter moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/943107368589692928) and a [Storify story](https://storify.com/cpjobling/socmedhe17) (plus [archive](https://cpjobling.github.io/stories/socmedhe17.html)) of the event, but from my remote vantage point, the highlights were:

*   [The build your own conference (or BYOC)](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/byoc/)
*   The Lego Serious Play session (lots of ducks)
*   David Webster and Lucy Cadbury on [Saying no to fun](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/saying-no-to-fun-putting-social-media-in-its-place/?doing_wp_cron=1513710473.1469919681549072265625)
*   The mince pies
*   Sue Beckingham and Simon Horrock's expose of [University leaders who tweet](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/papers-at-socmedhe17/1779-2/)
*   [The twalk.](https://blogs.shu.ac.uk/socmedhe/papers-at-socmedhe17/walk-this-way-reflections-on-a-twalk/)

I went last year and I hope to go next year. I just need something to present!
