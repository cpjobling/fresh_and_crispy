I've been a teacher in engineering and technology for over 30 years. I love computing, coding, and ed tech. I spend hours on-line watching videos to increase my understanding of the technologies that I love. I love engaging with my personal learning networks, particularly [#LTHEChat](https://lthechat.com) and [#CreativeHE](https://plus.google.com/communities/110898703741307769041). I take part in MOOCs and am curious about teaching and learning and how to do it. I'm a course leader and want my students to have the best experience possible. I think I'm a good mentor to my colleagues and respected for my experience,knowledge and skills and in my institution. What I haven't cracked is translating my enthusiasm for my subjects into engagement in the classroom.

Part of this stems from my natural reserve. I am definitely not an extrovert. I don't find it natural to be the life-and-soul-of-the-party. Social occasions are difficult for me in real life. (Interestingly I'm more extroverted in social media.) So perhaps I don't come across as enthusiastic in the classroom setting. I'm better one-on-one and in small group contexts, but most of my students don't get to experience that.

So how do I improve? I'm hoping the Enthusiastic HE community can help!
