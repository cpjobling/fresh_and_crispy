![2017-12-12_09-39-20](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-12_09-39-20.png)Today, was day one of the [2017 ALT Winter Conference](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/#/day1) (#[altc](https://twitter.com/hashtag/altc?f=tweets&vertical=default)) and I was supposed to chair the 10:00 am session "[The Great Sussex Podblast](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/sessions/the-great-sussex-podblast-1236/)" to have been delivered by Pete Sparx, George Robinson and Tab Betts from Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) at the University of Sussex. Unfortunately, problems with the Conference Webcasting platform (Blackboard Collaborate Ultra) and it's back up (Blackboard Collaborate Classic) meant that the session had to be cancelled. Hence, my first opportunity to moderate a webcast of any kind passed me by! The guys did, however, [create a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gp6BJSZ-jrpUNQ_K71m5JBoBTC-TNqfT/view), slides ([bit.ly/podblast-altc](https://bit.ly.com/podblast-altc)) and you can hear the Podblast podcasts here: [soundcloud.com/teachingwithtech/sets/great-sussex-podblast-digital](https://soundcloud.com/teachingwithtech/sets/great-sussex-podblast-digital).

In other events, there were five tweet chats. I was able to participate in [VLE Minimum Standards—Lessons from the Sector](http://VLE Minimum Standards – Lessons from the Sector) (hashtag: #[UCISAVLE](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23UCISAVLE&src=typd)) and watch the [#altc blog showcase](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/sessions/altc-blog-showcase-12389/) (hashtag: #[altcshowcase](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23altcshowcase&src=tyah)).

I then had a meeting to attend so I will need to catch up with the other sessions via the webinar recordings and wait for the storify versions of the tweetchats:

*   *   [“Player Two has entered” – Learning through console-based video games](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/sessions/player-two-has-entered-learning-through-console-based-video-games-1204/) (hashtag: [#consolesDGBL\_ALT](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23consolesDGBL_ALT))
    *   [Learning by numbers: how can analytics help educators?](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/sessions/learning-by-numbers-how-can-analytics-help-educators-1240/) (hashtags: [#learninganalytics #altc](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23learninganalytics%20%23altc&src=typd)) and
    *   [Open educational practice: #oep A DIY manifesto](https://altc.alt.ac.uk/online2017/sessions/open-educational-practice-oep-a-diy-manifesto-1202/) (hashtags: [#altc #oep](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23altc%20and%20%23oep&src=typd)).

I will have more time tomorrow to attend the live sessions.
