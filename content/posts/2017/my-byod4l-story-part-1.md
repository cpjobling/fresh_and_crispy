In advance of the [fifth run of bring your own device for learning (#BYOD4L)](http://blog.cpjobling.me/2016/12/09/byod4l-v-this-time-its-personal/) and inspired by Sheila McNeil's post "[#BYOD4L A story of personal and professional needs and wants](https://howsheilaseesit.blog/2017/01/06/byod4l-a-story-of-personal-and-professional-needs-and-wants/)", I thought that I too would reflect on my experience of my last three #BYOD4Ls.

Looking back at my [Twitter Archive](https://cpjobling.github.io/cpjobling-tweets/), I find that my first #BYOD4L contribution was a retweet on 14th July 2014:

I'm struggling to find any blog posts from what was then the 2nd run of #BYOD4L (the first looks to have been in January 2014) so I probably only engaged via Twitter and Google+.

I note that I was sticking my nose in quite early!

For curation, it looks like I was favouring these tools:

Reviewing these today, [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/cpjobling?page=6&query=%23BYOD4L), is being updated automatically, I'm an inactive curator on Anne Hole's [BYOD4L Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/@annehole/byod4l-ee1lr99iz), I'm still using "favourites" on twitter but have stopped using Pocket, Pearltrees and Evernote!

I've had a dig around the [Google+ site](https://plus.google.com/communities/115166756393440336480) and Twitter but can't find anything that I actually created that first outing, but here are a couple of shares that are worth revisiting:

And some opinions that I expressed:

As this post is already getting quite long and [#LTHEChat 72 is about to start](https://lthechat.com/2017/01/07/lthechat-72-student-engagement-new-year-new-partnership-raisenetwork/), I'll stop there, and continue this story in Part 2 tomorrow.

\[…\] Best of all, you can collect open badges for participation gather evidence of CPD that you can bring to your PGCertHE, HEA fellowship (initial application or evidence of good standing) and PDR. Mindful of this, for this run the organizers are encouraging us to share the stories of our experiences. So, to get your thinking, here’s one of mine. \[…\]

\[…\] I really enjoy #byod4l and the effective way it brings people together to share practice. As Chris Jobling has done it’s a great way to reflect on how your own use of technology has \[…\]
