In July's SALT Conference, I presented a demonstration of OneNote Class Notebook to my colleagues. As it was a bit chaotic and unstructured, I prepared presentation in Sway that I made [available after the session](https://sway.com/szqxSDT1Bq6H6EHf?ref=Link&loc=mysways). (I also promised a video which is still on my to-do-list.)

Interestingly, our own Paul Manning (@[PaulCManning](https://twitter.com/PaulCManning)) and OneNote Central (@[OneNoteC)](https://twitter.com/OneNoteC)Â spotted my Sway and after a short twitter conversation that turned to [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams/default.aspx), @OneNoteC tweeted a useful collection of resources on Teams for Education:

Within [this collection](https://padlet.com/pad184/Microsoft_Teams_Education_Resource_Collection), there is a link to a Webinar "Modern Classroom Collaboration: Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education" hosted by Raanah Amjadi _et al_. of Microsoft Canada (Jun 8, 2017) which I signed up for yesterday and watched this morning.

It's well worth doing the same to get an inkling of how Microsoft is pitching @[MicrosoftTeams](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftTeams) and @[msonenote](https://twitter.com/msonenote) as a classroom environment that looks viable as a replacement for institutional LMS and VLE offerings. I think that it may well disrupt the market for the simple reason that it's built on Office 365 and uses the same content delivery and collaboration tools that students will use after graduation. Perhaps, for the first time in this market, there is a set of tools that teachers are already using in their day-to-day work, that can be used to develop courses and activities that provide an authentic and transferable experience to students.

Office 365 for Education is free for all institutions from K-12 through Higher Ed so this is a very smart move!

I intend to introduce students on EG-252 to Teams and Planner (already available at my University) but if the Teams for Classroom features are activated in time, I may well use it for my modules EGLM03 and EG-247 next year.
