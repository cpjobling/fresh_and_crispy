At last year's SALT conference (#[SUSALT17](https://saltconference2017.wordpress.com/)), I ran a session on using the **OneNote Class Notebook** (ONCN) with the [same title as this post](https://saltconference2017.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/onenote-classroom-notebook-your-new-vle/). The title, of course, was meant to be provocative, but having used the [OneNote Class Notebook](https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook) for three years now, I believe that it has great potential, is getting a lot of love from Microsoft, and deserves to be more widely known.

In this series of posts, I will attempt to open up my 2017 talk to a wider audience and bring in a discussion of [Teams for Education](https://education.microsoft.com/courses-and-resources/resources/meet-microsoft-teams), demonstrate the new [ONCN plugin for Blackboard](https://www.onenote.com/lti), and showcase my own use of ONCN in teaching.

To start things off, I'll repeat what I did in my talk and start with a survey.

Please feel free to complete it. I'll report the findings in a few days time.
