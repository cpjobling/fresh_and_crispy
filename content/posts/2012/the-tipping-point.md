Early on this term I decided that HTML5 had reached sufficient traction to make it worth changing the flavour of HTML to be covered in my two modules EG-146 and EG-259. Now it seems that the media is starting to support my decision. As reported in this week’s [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/ "Subscribe Here.") (Issue #37 – May 9, 2012) the BBC had a [Business News Report on the Rise of HTML5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17931814?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email "Coding the future: HTML5 takes the internet by storm") and in the same issue, there’s a link to an article on why (newspaper and magazine) [publishers don’t like apps](http://www.technologyreview.com/business/40319/?p1=BI "Why Publishers Don't Like Apps The future of media on mobile devices isn't with applications but with the Web.") which rather echoes my view expressed [earlier this year](http://blog.cpjobling.me/2012/02/08/the-trouble-with-apps/ "The Trouble with Apps"). (Having tried and failed to tweet a link to that very article from the Google iPad App, my opinion has hardened.)

**Postscript**: EG-259 students should also checkout [Polyfills for the Pragmatist](http://lojjic.github.com/html5denver-polyfills/slides.html#1).
