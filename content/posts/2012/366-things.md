I’ve just [started another 366 photos project](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157628714247033 "2012 366 Photos") and I’ve also got a “[366 days of origami](http://flic.kr/p/b7WsKt "365 Origami Calendar")” calendar. In addition, Alan Levine and Jim Groom are about to launch a “Daily Create” project. I think it’s in testing (there’s a hint about it in [Thinking in Photos](http://cogdogblog.com/2012/01/06/thinking-on-photos/ "Thinking on Photos") on the CogDogBlog). In anticipation, here’s a video I made of one of my dad’s oldest and worse jokes:

**Update**

*   I now have a Tumblr blog to showcase these 366 things at [366 Crispy Things](http://366crispythings.tumblr.com/ "366 Crispy Things on Tumblr.").
*   The Daily Create assignments are part of the about-to-be launched Digital Story Telling open course [DS106](http://ds106.us "Digital Story Telling").
