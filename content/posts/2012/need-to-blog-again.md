With my daughter now [staring her own blog](http://gluehweinundlebkuchen.wordpress.com/), I feel guilty that my blog has been silent for so long. “I’ve been busy” is some kind of excuse, I suppose, but I know that I’ll be even busier next year. Perhaps I need some inspiration. Anyone got any ideas for me?
