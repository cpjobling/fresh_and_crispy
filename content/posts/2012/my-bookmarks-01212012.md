*   [Tutorial: Case Study with Html5 + CSS3 | Abduzeedo | Graphic Design Inspiration and Photoshop Tutorials](http://abduzeedo.com/tutorial-case-study-html5-css3)

“Last month I did a talk at the Campus Party, one of the biggest technology events of the world, talking about Fireworks, HTML5 and CSS3. It was very nice, the receptivity of the audience was sensational, and thinking that many of you would also like to see the contents of the workshop, so decided to write a full case study and share here on the blog.”
