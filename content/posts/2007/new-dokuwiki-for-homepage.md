I have installed an instance of \[DokuWiki\](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki) which I am intending to use as a home page. Its current location is \[eehope.swan.ac.uk/~eechris/dokuwiki/index.php\](http://eehope.swan.ac.uk/%7Eeechris/dokuwiki/index.php) but eventually I hope to move it to \[eehope.swan.ac.uk/~eechris\](http://eehope.swan.ac.uk/%7Eeechris).
