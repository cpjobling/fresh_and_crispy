I have subscribed to this Blog in [Oremi](http://oremi.swan.ac.uk) (Swansea University’s implementation of [Elgg](http://elgg.org/)) so this entry should appear both in my RSS aggregator (called _Resources_ in Oremi) and also as a Blog entry inside my Oremi space. I have similarly added by del.icio.us bookmarks to the same feature, so if I bookmark this item, it should also appear as a Blog entry inside Oremi. I have been [less than impressed](http://oremi.swan.ac.uk/eechris/weblog/755.html) by Oremi’s blogging and wiki features so far. If this works, it would be actually quite a useful feature!
