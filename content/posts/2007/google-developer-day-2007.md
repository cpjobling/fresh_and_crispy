Dion Almaer \[blogs\](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/05/google-developer-day-fantastic.html) about the Google Developer Day which took place at several locations worldwide on 31st May. I stumbled upon the announcement of \[Google Gears\](http://youtube.com/watch?v=cQyha30nm6k) yesterday among the growing collection of \[YouTube\](http://youtube.com/profile\_videos?user=GoogleDeveloperDay&p=r) videos recorded at the various events. Expect to see follow-ups and links to comments on this event and the technologies announced at Dionâ€™s \[Google Code Updates\](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com) blog and reviews of some of the key videos here.
