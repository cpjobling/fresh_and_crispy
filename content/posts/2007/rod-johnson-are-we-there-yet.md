Just published on \[InfoQ\](http://www.infoq.com/) is a video recorded at last year’s \[Java and Object-oriented\](http://jaoo.dk/conference/) (JAOO) software engineering conference. Rod, Enterprise Java guru and original developer of the Spring Framework gives a “\[state of the union\](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/rod-johnson-are-we-there-yet)” statement on Enterprise Java in which he states that progress has been made but we still have a ways to go. In particular he points to the need to put Domain Objects and Domain Driven Design at the centre of our enterprise applications and argues for an architecture that in some sense inverts the traditional service-layered model of enterprise applications. It would appear that AOP and dynamic languages will have a large contribution to play in achieving this. It also acts as a fairly low-key but nonetheless visible advertisement to the version 2.0 release of the \[Spring Framework\](http://www.springframework.org/).
