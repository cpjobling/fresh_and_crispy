Google runs a regular programme of educational presentations by eminent software developers about interesting web and code development technologies, tools and techniques. The great thing is that the presentations are videoed and put on-line on Google video. It also seems to go out and about in recording events at local user groups and records those as well. I discovered this great resource a couple of days ago and have been taking advantage of the Easter break to soak some of this good stuff during the Easter break. Probably the best way to find something of interest is to go to \[Google video\](http://video.google.co.uk) and search for tag \*engEDU\*. Google video provides an facility to generate RSS from tags, so the easy way to keep up to date is to subscribe to the feed: [http://video.google.co.uk/videofeed?type=search&q=engEDU&output=rss](http://video.google.co.uk/videofeed?type=search&q=engEDU&output=rss). If you do this in Google reader, the video is embedded right there in your RSS reader.
