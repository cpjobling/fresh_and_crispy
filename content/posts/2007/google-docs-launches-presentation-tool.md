And Common Craft tells you why it matters!

On on Tuesday 18th September, Google \[announced\](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-feature-presentation.html) the arrival of a new collaborative presentation tool which they call simply \*presentation \*. Annew member of the \[Google Docs suite\](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-feature-presentation.html) (which already includes a collaborative Word Processor and a Spreadsheet application), \*presentation\* provides a web-based tool for creating and developing presentations. It’s not as capable as PowerPoint, but probably passes the 80-20 rule. Plus it’s collaborative (you can share presentation development duties with others) and web publishable. Here’s a \[quick and dirty presentation\](http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=ajggj8h93vqb\_156ctdxnb&fs=true) I made to test the tool and its sharing capabilities. If you’d like to test it’s collaboration capabilities, leave me a comment with your email and I’ll share it with you. In a carefully timed release, our friends at \[Common Craft\](http://www.commoncraft.com/), released another “plain english” video to \[explain why collaborative tools like Google Docs\](http://www.commoncraft.com/video-googledocs) are important. It’s Google centric (presumably Google commisioned the video), but the central tenets apply to other collaborative systems even \*sharepoint\*. Are you \*\*\*listening \*\*\*dear colleagues of mine!

Here’s the video:
