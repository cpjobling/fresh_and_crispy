After a recommendation in this week’s Technology Guardian I discovered \[LibraryThing\](http://www.librarything.com) another beta/web2.0/link/social/tagging web site. This time for books. I’ve started putting \[my book collection\](http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=cpjobling) into it. Apart from the benefits of having a complete library catalogue on-line, the social networking aspects could be interesting. It can also be used in marking books for a class reading list. See \[EG-146 Reading List\](http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?tag=eg-146) as an example.
