In a knowing echo to Edward R. Murrow’s indictment of Senator Joe McCarthy (recently immortalized in [George Clooney’s film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433383/) film), [Keith Olbermann](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/) has used the closing of his eve-of-July 4th[MSNBC Countdown](http://www.alternet.org/story/55995) program (link includes video) to publicly castigate the current President and Vice President of the United States – suggesting that they both resign. To paraphrase the [tag line](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19588942/):

> “I didn’t vote for him,” \[John Wayne referring to JFK\] once said, “But he’s my president, and I hope he does a good job.”
> 
> That—on this eve of the 4th of July—is the essence of \[U.S.\] democracy, in 17 words. And that is what President Bush threw away yesterday in commuting the sentence of Lewis “Scooter” Libby.
