Here’s a \[nice example\](http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001455.html) of what can be done with Java applets! After downloading the (full!) JRuby implementation as an applet Dion shows that a little JavaScript can make it possible to execute a Ruby program in the browser. In the example, JRuby scripts are evaluated “onclick” and from a text input window.

I wonder if anyone has done this with Groovy too?
