Seen in today’s Guardian is [news](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2113098,00.html) of the impending July 27th release of the BBC’s new content-on-demand [iPlayer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6240000/newsid_6243100/6243174.stm). Unfortunately, acording to the article and Guardian blogger [Bobbie Johnson](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/06/27/finally_iplayer_to_launch_next_month.html), it won’t run on Vista which adds it to a growing list of essential software (which includes Quicktime and iTunes) which won’t run on my newly upgraded laptop. Still, we still have XP on the computer at home so next time we miss an episode of [Dalziel and Pascoe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/dalziel/) because of a recording clash on the Sky+ box, all will not be lost!
