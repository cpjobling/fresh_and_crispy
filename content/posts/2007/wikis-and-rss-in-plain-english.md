I’m indebted to Brady Forrest on [O’Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/teach_the_wiki.html) for the link to this cool video by Lee & Sachi LeFever that explains how Wiki works. There’s also a companion video [RSS in Plain English](http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english) that I haven’t embedded here, but which is just as good.
