\[Roumen Strobl\](http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/) is a Netbeans “evangelist” who works for Sun in Prague. He produces the \[Netbeans Podcast\](http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/category/Podcasts) and numerous screencast demos of the \[Netbeans IDE\](http://www.netbeans.org). In this very \[useful article\](http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/entry/recording\_high\_quality\_demos\_screencasts) he explains how he creates screencasts (like \[this one\](http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/entry/why\_netbeans)) and it’s well worth reading to find out how a professional does it!
