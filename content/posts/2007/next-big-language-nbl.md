Following a link in Stefan Tilkov’s [blog](http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/06/25/the_next_big_language_on_rails.html) to another blog entry by John Lam which claims that Rails has been [ported to JavaScript](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/steve-yegge-por.html) by Steve Yegge of Google, I came across this [intriguing article](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html) by Mr Yegge published back in February. He gives a lot of hints but doesn’t actually name the NBL: but from the speculation in the comments and now this announcement, it looks like it might have been JavaScript!

### Followup

[InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com) has published an [article](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/06/yegge-rhino-on-rails) on the blogosphere’s buzz around [Steve Yegge](http://www.iunknown.com/)‘s presentation of the JavaScript (Rhino) port of rails at [FooCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOO_Camp). The article quotes heavily from Steve’s own [posted response](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html) to all of the interest. But I find Steve’s work interesting mainly because it reveals the unexpected power of the Rhino JavaScript interpreter which of course is built in to Java SE 6 and runs on the JVM _on the server_.
