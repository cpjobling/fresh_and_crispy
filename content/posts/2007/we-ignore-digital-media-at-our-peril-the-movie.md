In a follow-up to his blog article on [Digital Media](http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html) (reported in my article about [serendipity](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/06/day-in-20-life-part-3_25.html)), OU Educational Technologist Tony Hirst has used the web 2.0 site [SplashCast](http://splashcastmedia.com/) to mash up a presentation with the cited videos. [Here’s](http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010459.html) Tony’s blog article, and [here](http://web.splashcast.net/preview/?s=IVTH3836KD) is the presentation. The end result serves both as an interesting introduction to the educational possibilities of digital media and an interesting case study of what can be done with access to video sharing sites and the web.
