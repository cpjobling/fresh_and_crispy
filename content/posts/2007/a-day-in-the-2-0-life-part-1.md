Introduction
------------

Over the last year or so I have been dipping my toes more and more into the on-line world and experiencing first-hand the Web 2.0 phenomenon. I thought it was time I formally started to report my experiences and reflect on how I am using Web 2.0 technologies. So this is part 1 in a planned series of essays on living life online. Hopefully there’ll be something that others, particularly colleagues at [Swansea University](http://www.swansea.ac.uk/), will be able to pick up. I’ll tag these articles [_mylifeonline_](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/search/label/mylifeonline) for ease of reference.

My Window on the world

My browser of choice is [Firefox](http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/dokuwiki) which I launch at the start of my working day (I really need to add it to my Windows start up). On launch it comes up with several tabs already pre\-loaded as shown in here (click on the image to see the screen shot at full resolution).

\[!\[\](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/\_\_bnNGgqRugY/RnGMtVJzR\_I/AAAAAAAAAhc/ffjW2Gm-0iM/s200/myfirefox.png)\](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/\_\_bnNGgqRugY/RnGMtVJzR\_I/AAAAAAAAAhc/ffjW2Gm-0iM/s1600-h/myfirefox.png) Left to right the tabs hold: - My \[TiddlyWiki\](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) which holds my notes, to do list etc. I’ll blog more about that another time. - My \[iGoogle\](http://www.google.co.uk/ig) portal that provides quick access to my \[Google Mail\](http://mail.google.com/) mail and \[Google Reader\](http://www.google.co.uk/reader) which is my \[RSS feed\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) \[aggregator\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregators) of choice (of which more later). - \[My Blog\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/) (which you’re reading). - My \[Unofficial University Homepage \](http://eehope.swan.ac.uk/~eechris)(a \[DokuWiki\](http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/dokuwiki) wiki). - The\[LiterateProgramming.org\](http://en.literateprograms.org/LiteratePrograms:Welcome) site (a \[MediaWiki\](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)wiki) to which I contribute articles. - and \[Wikipedia\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main\_Page). \[!\[\](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/\_\_bnNGgqRugY/RnGIclJzR-I/AAAAAAAAAhU/JRik9BOU\_X8/s200/del.icio.us.png)\](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/\_\_bnNGgqRugY/RnGIclJzR-I/AAAAAAAAAhU/JRik9BOU\_X8/s1600-h/del.icio.us.png)You can also see that I have the Firefox\[del.icio.us\](http://del.icio.us/) \[extension\](http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension) installed. It’s an important part of my work flow which I’ll be describing in a later article. In the \[next article\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/06/day-in-20-life-part-2.html), I’ll describe how I use my RSS feed reader.
