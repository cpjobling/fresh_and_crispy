In my pursuit of [procrastination](http://lifehacker.com/software/procrastination/) (I’m supposed to be writing supplementary \[summer resit\] examinations) I’ve been through my feeds and am now watching Stephanie Booth’s excellent Google Tech Talk on [Localization](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5004419583730327409) (which incidentally is a trickier problem than most English speakers realise). Whilst listening, I was following the links to Stephanie’s blog [Climb to the Stars](http://climbtothestars.org/) and from there to her [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/steph) link collection and discovered a useful tip. She bookmarks links to the [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) (Internet Movie Database) record for the films that she’s seen and tags them [films seen cinema](http://del.icio.us/steph/seen+films+cinema) , [films seen dvd](http://del.icio.us/steph/seen+films+dvd), etc. What an elegant, great, simply superb, absurdly simple idea! Ideal for the completist who must make sure that he’s seen every one of the [1000 films to see before you die](http://film.guardian.co.uk/1000films/0,,2108487,00.html) before he dies. And it’s so easily adapted to books, recordings, rugby matches or anything else you’d want to remember.

Oh … and Stephanie’s talk on the issues of localization for web application developers is also thought provoking and well worth watching.
