\### Serendipity: or the fundamental interconnectedness of all things

\> \[The World Wide Web is\] the only thing I know of whose shortened form — www — takes three times longer to say than what it’s short for. – Douglas Adams

When reading \[my river of news\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/06/day-in-20-life-part-2.html), I often come across interesting cross-links and related ideas. (I guess because I am reading lots of sources there are \*bound \*to be some that are related.) Nevertheless, I am often struck by how mysteriously \[serendipitous\](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/serendipity) these discovered links often are! Take for example my experience today. Early in my feed reading I came across this \[blog entry\](http://swansea-learninglab.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-to-use-powerpoint.html) in the \[Learning lab\](http://learninglab.swan.ac.uk) about how \*not \*to make PowerPoint presentations. Later on, I found Tony Hirst’s \[article\](http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/010445.html) about Digital Media which included that video, as well as \[this example of a good PowerPoint presentation\]() that I’d seen and \[bookmarked\](http://del.icio.us/cpjobling/identity+presentation) some time ago, and much else beside. As \[Dirk Gently\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk\_Gently) would probably say “be open to the \*fundadamental interconnectedness of all things\*.”
