Eric Amstrong has published a nice [summary](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=205945) of some of the main topics that caught his attention at this year’s JavaOne. The topics are listed as:

*   Scripting Languages on the JVM
*   Improved JRE Insallations
*   Java Quick Start Service
*   Java Modules
*   Java 7 Language
*   Java 7 Tools
*   User Interface Testing with FEST
*   Sun ID System
*   DITA Pod
*   Writing DSLs in Ruby

and I have highlighted the ones of particular interest to me. Eric’s article is a good place to start on an exploration of the technical session video casts when they become available.
