Charles Nutter has today \[blogged\](http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/06/jruby-100rc3-released-and-this-is-it.html) that JRuby 1.0.0RC3 has been released and that this is expected to be the final release candidate before the release of 1.0 which will follow later this week. Time to try it out I guess!
