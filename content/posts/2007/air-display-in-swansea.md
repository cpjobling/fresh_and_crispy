Renate and I watched the Red Arrows from Swansea Beach today. The display was part of a two day Air Display put on by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Swansea City and County Council. I took a little bit of footage on my little Canon IXUS 50 and I edited the footage into a little movie which I uploaded to YouTube.  

Iâ€™ve also uploaded a few photos to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cpjobling/sets/72157602034540414/). Enjoy!
