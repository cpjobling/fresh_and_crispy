I was at a “lunch and learn” session on Monday talking about Personalized Learning Environments and someone asked a question about custom searches for research and RSS feeds. I just found this \[article\](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/09/06/creating-google-custom-search-engines.html) cited in \[Lifehacker\](http://lifehacker.com/software/google/step-by-step-guide-to-making-a-custom-search-engine-297785.php) which may answer those questions.
