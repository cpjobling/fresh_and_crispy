> So we’re all agreed. Blogs: good; email: bad. Wikis: good; sending round attachments to a dozen people and then having to merge all the changes by hand afterwards: bad.

This one goes out to all my colleagues who really do want to send out attachments by email and merge changes manually. (No, I tell a lie, they want to send out printouts of documents and merge red-lined versions back into the electronic documents manually!) Here’s a [presentation](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5259885968345773781) by Suw Charman (note **no Powerpoint**!!) recorded at Google HQ and released in the [Google TechTalks](http://almaer.com/techtalkshowcase/) series that spells out the barriers to social tools and why it might be good to embrace change. This is why I live my life on the web: welcome to my world!

(Note: video is 55 minutes long, so lock the door, take the phone off the hook and grab a coffee before hitting play.)
