The \[Swansea Learning Lab\](http://learninglab.swan.ac.uk) had planned that tomorrow there would be a “lunch and learn” \[E-Learning Showcase\](http://swansea-learninglab.blogspot.com/2007/10/e-learning-showcase-come-and-find-out.html) at which I was going to present the “Blackboard Quest”. Unfortunately, due to lack of interest, this session has been postponed. However, as I already had the slides ready, I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone and share what I was going to say anyway and test-drive a nifty new Web 2.0 feature at \[slideshare.net\](http://www.slideshare.net/), that allows the on-line creation of a narrated slide show (or \*slidecast\*) to be created. I uploaded my presentation slides and synched it to an MP3 commentary and \[here it is\](http://www.slideshare.net/cpjobling/the-blackboard-quest). If you’re at Swansea, and you want to find out more, some additional material has been made available in the \[blackboard quest community\](https://oremi.swan.ac.uk/bbquest/) in \[Oremi\](oremi.swan.ac.uk).
