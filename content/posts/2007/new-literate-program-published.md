I have published another literate program on [literateprograms.org](http://www2.blogger.com/en.literateprograms.org). This one shows how the [Rot13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoding system can be implemented in Java. However, that is trivial! The real point is to document the basic use of JUnit testing and Apache Ant which are standard tools in the professional Java developerâ€™s toolbox (in fact they make Java just about usable ![:-)](http://blog.cpjobling.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Within 24 hours of the first mention of my program, another literate programmer had documented the altogether [more elegant](http://en.literateprograms.org/Rot13_%28Sed%29) implementation as a _sed_ script. My guess is that a [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) implementation would, if not quite as elegant, be much simpler than the Java version.
