[![RESTful web services by Richardson and Ruby (O'Reilly) [cover from Amazon.co.uk]](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/518TAgBUwKL._AA240_.jpg)](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/518TAgBUwKL._AA240_.jpg) I’ve just ordered _RESTful Web Services_ by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby (Published May 2007, O’Reilly Media Inc). I plan to have at least one lecture on [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) (representational state transfer) and up to now the only definitive reference was [Roy Fielding’s PhD thesis](http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). I was going to buy this book anyway but an interview with the authors and a free chapter available was made available yesterday on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/articles/richardson-ruby-restful-ws) prompted me to take action. For more on REST see also the [RESTWiki](http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage).
