Came across a recommendation of another Web-based _To Do List_ application while going through my RSS feeds this morning. This application was recommended by Lachlan Hardy on [Read/Write Web](http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/readwriteweb/%7E3/124057846/todoist_task_management.php) blog and so I signed up. One feature that immediately sets it apart is that it can link to _gmail_ via a Firefox plug-in, so if you come across an email that needs action you can tag it inside _gmail_ and it is added to your to do list. I plan to write a longer article about Web 2.0 Tools that I use in my daily life, so Iâ€™ll report back on my experiences when I have some!
