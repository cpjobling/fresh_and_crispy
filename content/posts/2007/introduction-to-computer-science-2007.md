Harvard College Extension School’s “Introduction to Computer Science” is running again. This course, run by David J. Malan, is an excellent example of the use of multimedia for distance learning. The 12 week programme (which recommenced on 17th September) is designed for adult learners and distance learning and goes from bits and bytes through algorithms, programming and the web. David invites the world to follow along by making audio and video recordings of his lectures, his notes and additional golden nuggets of content that are provided by his teaching assistants, all available through an RSS feed. Here’s the link: [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie1/podcast/](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~cscie1/podcast/).

I shall be tuning in, if only because David and his colleagues are really good at teaching and I’m always on the look out for new tips. Plus, I will probably learn something!
