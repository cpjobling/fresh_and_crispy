Iâ€™ve just been watching a \[video\](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6852287090518403675&q=engEDU+connexions), presented by Richard G. Baraniuk of Rice University, (part of the Google TechTalks series) on \[Connexions \](http://cnx.otg) a non-profit start-up launched at Rice University in 1999 that aims to reinvent how we write, edit, publish, and use textbooks. Very inspirational and certainly worth a deeper look.
