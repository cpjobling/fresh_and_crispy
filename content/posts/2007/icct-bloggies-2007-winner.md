As an exercise in one of my level one courses I get my students to write a blog on some research topic of their choosing. I then get them to assess each othersâ€™ blog and award each other marks for content. This blog on [Spam in the Internet](http://internetspam.blogspot.com/) was the winning entry this year. The others were:

*   [The history of the Internet](http://historyofthenet.blogspot.com/)
    
*   [hamad.blog](http://443394.blogspot.com/)
    
*   [Global warming](http://assignmentfor153.blogspot.com/)
    
*   [Tackling Spam in the Internet](http://tacklingspam.blogspot.com/)
    
*   [The History of the Worl-wide Web](http://historyoftheworldwideweb.blogspot.com/)
