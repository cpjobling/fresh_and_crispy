It’s been a while but I’m _sort of_ back in harness after my vacation (even if actually at home in my pyjamas). One of the issues that always occurs after a period away is dealing with the email after a period away. To this end, this video by Merlin Mann of [43folders](http://www.43folders.com) may help. It provides some useful tips about how to deal with after-vacation email as well as the ongoing problem of dealing with email on a daily basis. It comes down to a simple strategy for processing email: **empty the email inbox every time that you visit it**. You do this by some variation of a processing procedure that does one of these five things with each message:

*   delete (or archive)
    
*   delegate
    
*   respond
    
*   defer
    
*   do
    

Watch the video for more detail and for the interesting discussion (with Google knowledge workers) and be inspired!
