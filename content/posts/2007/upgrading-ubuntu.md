Upgrading Ubuntu is apparently only possible using the _alternative CD_ or over the network. Having tried and failed to leap over 6.10 to install directly from the 7.04 “Feisty Fawn” release onto my old laptop I reinstalled 6.06 LTS “Dapper Drake” with a separate home partition (an implicit recommendation that doesn’t seem to be the default) with the intention of upgrading. The recommendation would appear to be to do this release by release. But apparently, it can be done over the network using gksu “update-manager -c” or from the _Alternative CD_ using gksu “sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade”. As I don’t have the alternative CD for either 6.10 “Edgy Eft” or 7.04 “Feisty Fawn” it’ll be the network then! See you on the other side!
