I’m in the process of moving my [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) aggregation settings to [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader). The features that I like abou Google Reader that prompted this move are:

*   I can add multiple tags to RSS feeds
    
*   Reader shows you what’s new (and also what’s old) in all feeds or across tagged items: no more navigating complex folder structures
    
*   the list display is easier to scan when you’re busy
    
*   it’s easy to share feeds or individual articles
    
*   you can [replace the traditional static blogroll with a dynamic list](http://thezeroboss.com/2007/01/04/how-to-kill-your-blogroll-with-google-readers-clips/) of hot topics (see _What’s tickling my fancy_ at left).
    

If only gmail had folders too!
