Today, my colleague Dr John Mason and I interviewed one of my MEng students who has submitted a research dissertation on _Free and Open Source Software in Engineering Education_. Just prior to the interview, John showed me [this site](http://www.iosn.net/education/foss-education-primer/) which he had picked up by Googling “[open source education brazil](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=open+source+education+brazil)“. It wasn’t picked up by my student in his literature review (which to be fair was directed to the more “professional” search engines on-line like [IET Inspec](http://www.iee.org/publish/inspec/) and [IEEE XPlore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/guesthome.jsp)) but it looks like a great resource and I shall need to add it to my list of sites worthy of a longer look.
