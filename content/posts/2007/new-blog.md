I have created a Google Code project for the continued development of one of my project studentâ€™s projects ([A Module Catalogue for my School](http://code.google.com/p/uws-soe-module-catalogue/)). This is the first of (I hope) many Google Hosted projects that will provide my students with valuable experience in the use of modern software project development tools.
