Announced on the W3C news site yesterday (13th June) and just today spotted while trawling my RSS feeds, is the news that Sir Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) has been appointed as a member of the [Order of Merit](http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=291481&NewsAreaID=2) by H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II.

Sir Tim, as you know, invented the World Wide Web, which made this blog possible, and so changed the world as we know it ;-). Heâ€™s definitely a hero of mine.

Congratulations to Tim!
