As a first part in a series of experiments on \[light-weight markup languages\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight\_markup\_language) (e.g. for blogs, wilkis, presentations etc) I have installed the \[PyBlosxom\](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/) blogging tool. It tool a few minutes more than the 10 minutes claimed in the \[user guide\](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/1.3.1/manual/x78.html). But itâ€™s working now. For future reference the URL (or should that be \[URI\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform\_Resource\_Identifier)) is \[http://tinyurl.com/2gyqvx\](http://tinyurl.com/2gyqvx). An advantage of PyBlosxom (and \[Perl Blosxom \](http://www.blosxom.com/) that inspired it) is that the blog entries are just text files which can be edited in any text editor and kept under version control. A rich family of plug-ins allows various transformations to take place when the blog is rendered by the pyblosxom.cgi script. These include \[reStructuredText\](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), \[textile\](http://textism.com/tools/textile/), \[markdown\](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), \[wikitext\](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitext), etc.
