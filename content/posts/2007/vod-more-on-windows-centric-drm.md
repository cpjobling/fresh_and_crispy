An interesting article “[Why TV on demand insists you use its chosen browser](http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,2123679,00.html)” by Kate Bevan in today’s [TechnologyGuardian](http://technology.guardian.co.uk/) indicates that it is not [only the BBC](http://www.blogger.com/2007/07/bbc-iplayer-for-all-sign-petition.html) that has wedded itself to a Microsoft Windows XP/IE/Media Player solution to its Video on Demand (VOD) service. Apparently Channel 4’s [40D service](http://www.channel4.com/4od/) has the same limitations, and I can report first hand that [SKY Anytime](http://anytime.sky.com/) doesn’t work on Vista either. Apparently it’s all a question of reaching the most users while satisfying the distribution restrictions of the rights holders.

There’s an additional issue that I found with Sky Anytime and that is the DRM is tied to the CPU, so make sure that you install it on a Windows XP that you don’t intend to upgrade to Vista. I upgraded my laptop, but even after uninstalling the software (which no longer worked) I couldn’t reinstall on another PC because my account was still tied to the Laptop! A long call to Customer Services is likely to be the only solution. Note to the developers: “Why can’t uninstalling reset the link to the CPU that is no longer running the software?”
