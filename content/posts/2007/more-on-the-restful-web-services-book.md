Jon Udell has \[blogged\](http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/05/24/restful-web-services/) about the new \[RESTful web services\](http://www.crummy.com/writing/RESTful-Web-Services/) book by Richardson and Ruby (see \[New book ordered\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/06/new-book-ordered.html)). In his post refers to an \[interview\](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/25.html) he did last year with Roy Fielding and another with the authors that was then in post production but was \[published\](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1830.html) today. I’ve got a coffee in my hand and I’m off to listen to them both.
