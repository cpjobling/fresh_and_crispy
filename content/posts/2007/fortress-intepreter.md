Mentioned in episode 100 of the [Java Posse](http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=174337) was a new (to me) open source language for the JVM called [Fortress](http://fortress.sunsource.net/). Using a notation that looks literally more like mathematics than either Mathematica or Matlab, and claiming a place in the application domains that have been Fortranâ€™s province since year dot, this looks like a language and a project that deserves further study.
