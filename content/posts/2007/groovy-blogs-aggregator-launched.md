Glen Smith has launched a new blog aggregation site called GroovyBlogs.org. Created in just [20 hours in Grails](http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen/2007/02/28/1172662853575.html "20 Hour Grails Challenge"), the site attempts to gather all the news thatâ€™s hot in the Groovy world and present it in one place. The source code is also available.
