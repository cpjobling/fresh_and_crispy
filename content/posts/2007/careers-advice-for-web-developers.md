A useful survey of the top 10 programming languages used in web development by Stephen Ward of [dailybits.com](http://www.dailybits.com/) has been [published](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/10_most_marketable_web_development_skills.php) on [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com). In addition to HTML and CSS, my students have some experience of Java, JavaScript, PHP, ASP.NET/C# and SQL and they see Ruby on Rails in action. So weâ€™re doing a good job of building up a good portfolio of marketable skills at Swansea University.
