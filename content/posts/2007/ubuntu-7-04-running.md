I completed the installation of Ubuntu 7.04 \[started yesterday\](http://crispyj2.blogspot.com/2007/05/upgrading-ubuntu.html) and it worked across the network just fine. I then installed \[Automatix2\](http://www.getautomatix.com/) as recommended by \[Geertjan\](http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/ubuntu\_7\_04\_beryl\_streaming) and installed a bunch of development tools (Java 6, Eclipse, Netbeans). Interesting to note that the Automatix2 Eclipse bundle seems to have been tuned for Linux development and comes with PyDev, various Apache Commons libraries, Ant etc. Pity the Windows version doesnâ€™t!
