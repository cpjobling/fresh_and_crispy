Three items of note from Charles Nutter’s ‘blog: 1. \[JRuby 0.9.8\](http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/03/behind-scenes-jruby-098-released.html) has been released with 98% support for Ruby on Rails. The road to a 1.0 release seems well signposted.

3\. Netbeans support for Ruby and JRuby is “\[even better than expected\](http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/03/netbeans-6-ruby-support-even-better.html)” (see the \[demos\](http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/entry/two\_demos\_jruby\_on\_rails) on Roman Strobl’s blog)

5\. \[Ruby on Grails\](http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/03/ruby-on-grails-why-hell-not.html) – Charles has analyzed the contents of the grails project and concludes that it could easily be fronted by JRuby rather than Groovy. Grails developer Graeme Rocher \[agrees\](http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/2007/03/charles-nutter-ruby-on-grails-story.html). I would comment that that’s the beauty of dynamic languages: it leverages your investment in libraries and APIs!
