Version 2.0 of the RTS Specification ([JSR 1.0](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/realtime/index.jsp)) was announced in one of the [Keynotes](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/sessions/general/index.jsp) at [JavaOne 2007](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp). In [Podcast #124](http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=218817), _The Java Posse_ interview Greg Bollella and Dave Hofert of the Java RTS team. The interview gives a nice overview of what real-time means in the Java context. I’m now looking forward to the [release](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp) of the recorded lectures. (The slides are already available.) You have to join the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com) to access these, but registration is free.

While I’m here, let me recommend that every who’s interested in Java should tune in to the [Java Posse](http://javaposse.com/) podcast!
