While doing some vaguely formulated research today (it is a Bank Holiday so vagueness is allowed!), I did a search for Wiki on \[Google video\](http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?q=wiki) today and came across this video of a presentation by Jeremy Ruston (developer of \[TiddlyWiki\](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/)) recorded (I believe – the video description is a bit unclear) at a meeting on social software held in Vienna last year. You can’t see the slides, but it is clear that, for documentation, Jeremy has no love for the standard office tools and makes a good case for \[wikis\](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks) and in particular TiddlyWiki.
