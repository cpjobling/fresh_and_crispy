Just published by Lee LeFever on the [CommonCraft](http://www.commoncraft.com/) site is a new “paper works” video on Web 2.0. This time its [social networking](http://www.commoncraft.com/video-social-networking): which apparently is all about finding a life partner or finding a job. Since, in my case, I’m happy with both, I fear that social networking has little to offer. Still, enjoy the video.
