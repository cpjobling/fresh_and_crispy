The \[learning lab\](http://learninglab.swan.ac.uk) at my University launched its first podcast today. I feel obliged to blog about it as Chris Hall interviewed me about the \*Blackboard Quest\* that I developed as a Blackboard training exercise for first year engineers. The podcast is \[here\](http://learninglab.swan.ac.uk/podcasts.html). The interview itself is quite quiet compared to the rest of the podcast, but then people have always said that I mumble!
