Under the heading of \*it might be useful\* I \[signed up\](http://twitter.com/cpjobling) with Twitter. There don’t seem to be any tools (extensions, google gadgets, etc) that make it easy to use from Firefox as it seems that SMS and Instant Messaging would seem to be the preferred interface. And I guess for the purpose (quick notes to say what you’re doing) that makes sense. I’ll have to install an AIM client now though!
