So the [January 2018 run](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/byod4l-whats-it-all-about/) of **Bring  Your Own Device for Learning** (BYOD4L) is over! Thanks to [the team](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/about/the-team-jan-2018/), Sheila McNeil, Alex Spiers, Neil Withnell, Debbie Baff, and Suzanne Faulkner for their expert guidance!

I didn't do the tasks, but I did do a fair amount of _connecting_, _communicating_ and _curating_ this time.

My [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) record of #BYOD4L 2018 is [byod4l.cpjobling.net](http://byod4l.cpjobling.net). It's one HTML page (`index.html`) which you can copy by pressing the save button. (The magic is all done with JavaScript.)![](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_2475.jpg)
