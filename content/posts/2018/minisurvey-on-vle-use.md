[Last month](https://blog.cpjobling.net/oncn-as-vle/onenote-class-notebook-your-next-vle/) I started this sequence of posts on using [OneNote Class Notebook as a VLE](https://blog.cpjobling.net/category/oncn-as-vle/) by posting a simple 3-question survey using Microsoft forms. There have been four submissions (one was mine), so please [have a go](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=LrXKu76f1kOi859mxD3yaE7EMaJH6qVOq9ZC4JjYl99URURaTzRQUlhBQjUwUUdJR1BWN1JEMUxFTy4u) if you want to improve these results.

Here are the results.

1\. Do you use a VLE?
---------------------

100% of those who took the survey said yes!

2\. What kinds of content do you deliver through your VLE?
----------------------------------------------------------

No surprises here I guess. For most staff (and probably students too), the VLE is primarily seen as a content management system. Everyone uses PowerPoint and notes. It's pleasing to see videos, screencasts and pencasts being used. One respondent uses podcasts. Reading lists and announcements are used by all. The respondent who selected "other" uses Diigo feeds and embedded learning objects created in Xerte and Articulate.

The good news is that OneNote class notebook can support most of these use cases with file attachments. Office attachments will open in the native app. Some media types, audio and video, can be embedded; YouTube videos can be automatically inserted from the YouTube share link. Other media types may need to be linked to.

It's worth noting that OneNote pages support sophisticated text markup (with [excellent accessibility](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Accessibility-support-for-OneNote-7edc3c88-ca71-4c01-ba95-e2eee4cfcac2) features and the [unique learning tools](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Learning-Tools-eff7f7e3-7e21-42f0-a6f1-da7027f98261)), and there is [digital ink](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Draw-and-write-with-ink-in-Office-6D76C674-7F4B-414D-B67F-B3FFEF6CCF53) support (for handwritten annotations) which rivals the HTML editors provided by most VLEs.

3\. What "interactive" features of your VLE do you use in your teaching?

OneNote Class notebook on its own provides support for the equivalent of wikis (collaborative documents), Blogs, and ePortfolios. You would have to combine it with Microsoft Teams to have useful discussion boards (including video discussions powered by FlipGrid) and assignment tools (including grading rubrics). You can create very simple embedded quizzes and surveys using Microsoft Forms, but you'd need to link to your VLE or a third-party tool for more fully featured quizzes.

Having set the scene, in the next article in this series, I will describe the OneNote class notebook and how I use it!
