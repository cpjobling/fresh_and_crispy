In honour of the silver jubilee of the [Association for Learning Technology](https://www.alt.ac.uk/) (ALT), [ALT Conference 2018](https://www.alt.ac.uk/altc) Co-Chair Martin Weller has been compiling a personal history of the development of Educational Technology (Ed Tech) covering the years 1993 to the present. The final episode, [2018 Critical Ed Tech](http://blog.edtechie.net/25yearsedtech/25-years-of-edtech-2018-critical-ed-tech/) was published yesterday. Ranging from AI, through the web, eLearning, MOOCs, back to AI and on to blockchain -- like Lasers in the 60s, surely a technology looking for an application -- it's an entertaining look at all the disrupting technologies that somehow _failed_ _to disrupt_ education. And a sobering thought that I was there to _uncritically_ early-adopt a lot of it too!

You can read the whole lot by visiting the categoryÂ [25yearsedtech](http://blog.edtechie.net/category/25yearsedtech/) on Martin's **Ed Techie** blog.

Highly Recommended.
