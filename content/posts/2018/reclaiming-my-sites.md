My adventures of [Domain of One's Own](http://umwdtlt.com/a-brief-history-of-domain-of-ones-own-part-1/) with [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/domain-of-ones-own/) continues.

I've just resurrected the [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki#) that I used for various modules related to _Internet and Communications Technology_ (ICCT). You'll find this at its new home at [dokuwiki.cpjobling.net](http://dokuwiki.cpjobling.net).

I've also set up a new development blog using the static-website generation tool [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/). You'll find **Crispy Dev** hosted at [dev.cpjobling.net](https://dev.cpjobling.net) as well as on GitHub at [cpjobling.github.io/dev.cpjobling.net](https://cpjobling.github.io/dev.cpjobling.net).
