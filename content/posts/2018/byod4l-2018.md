![Cat in sillhouette](https://blog.cpjobling.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Photo012.jpg)It's time for [Bring Your Own Device for Learning 2018](https://byod4learning.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/monday-15th-january-2018-byod4l-day-1-and-the-theme-is-connecting-confidence/) (my 6th) and this year there are 5 additional C's (_Confidence_, _Capability_, _Copyright_, _Community_ and _Celebrating_) to add to the usual menu of _Connecting_,  _Communicating_, _Curating_, _Collaborating_, and _Creating_.

I'm probably not going to have the freedom that I had last year to contribute as much as I would like, but I _will_ be using a new curation tool – [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)  – and its mobile editing app [Quine](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Saving%2520on%2520iPad%252FiPhone.html).

You can follow my progress by checking out my [Byod4L TiddyWiki](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqkeutm6lu65zfg/index.html?dl=0) on Dropbox. Just download a copy of index.html and open it in a browser.
