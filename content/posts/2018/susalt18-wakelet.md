For those who couldn't make the [10th SALT conference](https://saltconference2018.wordpress.com/) held at the Bay Campus, here is a [Wakelet](https://wakelet.com/) I made of the tweets from the event.

If you want to learn more about Wakelets and how to make them, [the new way to curate social media posts and create stories using @wakelet](https://socialmediaforlearning.com/2018/04/07/the-new-way-to-curate-social-media-posts-and-create-stories-using-wakelet/) by Sue Beckingham (@[suebecks](https://twitter.com/suebecks)) is an excellent introduction.

\[…\] To livetweet an event means to tweet about it while you’re actually participating in it. Conferences or seminar presentations are often livetweeted. This may be done in an official capacity, with organisers inviting participants to livetweet the papers. There is often a pre-agreed ‘official’ hashtag to use. The hashtag can be used before, during and after the event. Following the hashtag can be a good way to find out who’s going to be there, what the papers were about, and any follow-up questions. Hashtagged tweets can be curated and shared after the event. Did you miss last year’s SALT Conference? You can still catch up on the tweets! \[…\]
