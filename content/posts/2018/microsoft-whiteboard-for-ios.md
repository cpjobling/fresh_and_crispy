Microsoft has recently released the iOS version of its new Whiteboard app and I recorded this quick video to give my first impressions. There is certainly already sufficient functionality here for me to want to use it in my classes.

The features that I like are:

*   Infinite size canvas -- like in OneNote.
*   Ruler for drawing straight lines at various angles.
*   Ink to shape.
*   Share to OneNote (as an image).
*   Share whiteboard with collaborators for brainstorming in meetings.
*   All whiteboards are stored in the cloud.

Features that it has that I didn't demonstrate

*   Add images
*   Sticky notes
*   Ink to table

There are some differences between the Windows and iOS versions but I imagine that they will become more compatible in time. I would also hope to see some of the additional drawing features supported by OneNote being added as the product develops.

The iOS version follows on from the Windows 10 version that has been available for a while. There is a preview version for the web.

If you want to give it a try, visit [whiteboard.microsoft.com](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com). You need a free Microsoft or an Office 365 account to use it.
