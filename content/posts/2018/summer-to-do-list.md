It's graduation next week, the official end of the University year and the start of the summer battery recharge. Inspired by a comment from my friend and colleague Chris Hall made at yesterday's #SUSALT18 Conference, I thought that it was time to reactivate my blog with a few thoughts on what I want to achieve over the summer.

So here, in no particular order, are the things on my todo list.

*   Annual module review of my own modules.
*   Final Board of Studies meeting
*   Away day for programme review (planning to use the [ABC LD Toolkit 2018](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/abc-ld/home/abc-ld-toolkit/) from UCL)
*   Learn how to use the Rohde-Schwartz instrumentation in our labs
*   Play with National Instruments micro DAC
*   Produce a how-to for embedding OneNote class notebooks into Blackboard
*   Survey of my college's Blackboard sites
*   Develop guidance for achieving the minimum standard
*   Help the University to define the data requirements for Annual Programme Review
*   Prepare my Senior Fellow HEA application
*   Train as an IET Accreditor
*   Properly flip my semester 2 courses.
*   Finish Laurillard's [Teaching as a Design Science](https://www.routledge.com/Teaching-as-a-Design-Science-Building-Pedagogical-Patterns-for-Learning/Laurillard/p/book/9780203125083) and finally read Talbert's book on [Flipped Learning](https://sty.presswarehouse.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=468277) and Nilson's on [Specifications grading](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Specifications-Grading-Restoring-Motivating-Students/dp/1620362422/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_9905632998?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&ie=UTF8).
*   Continue to advocate for wider use of [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for Committees, Work Groups, Communities of Practice, Courses and Students within my University.
*   Go on holiday
*   ALT Conference

Some of these will be part of my CPD, some may be of interest to my readers. However, I make no promise that any will become the subject of a future blog post.

One reason that I haven't felt the need to Blog for a while is that I have been keeping a (nearly daily) Journal in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). It's live, hosted in GitHub pages and reachable at [journal.cpjobling.net](http://journal.cpjobling.net).
