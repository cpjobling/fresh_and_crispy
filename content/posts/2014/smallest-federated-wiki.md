I am very excited by [Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW)](http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/smallest-federated-wiki) – the latest project from [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham), the inventor of the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb). I’ve been watching the [videos](http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/smallest-federated-wiki/video.fed.wiki.org/federated-wiki-videos) and playing with the [software](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) most of yesterday and today. I’ve also been inspired by [Mike Caulfeild](http://hapgood.us/about/)‘s explorations of the teaching and learning applications of SFW on his [blog](http://hapgood.us/?s=sfw) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/mikecaulfield73/featured).

After a bit of a struggle, I have managed to install my own copy of SFW as a node app, backed by a MongoHQ database on Heroku.

You’ll find it by following the link to [My Wiki](http://cpjwiki.heroku.com) and in the site links below.

I’ll post some installation instructions.
