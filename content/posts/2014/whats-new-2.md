You may have noticed some differences to **Fresh and Crispy** since your last visit. The most significant is that my blogging platform is now [Ghost](https://ghost.org) rather than WordPress. I'm also now hosting my domain on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) rather than [CastIron coding](http://castironcoding.com). This means that I have my stuff on a complete virtual machine rather than space on a shared server.

I'll be gradually moving my other resources over to my new domain over the next few weeks.
