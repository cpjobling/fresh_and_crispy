So, yesterday I was browsing my twitter feed and favourited a [post](http://heloukee.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/why-i-teach/) from Helen Keegan tagged [#whyIteach](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23whyIteach&src=typd) accompanied by the [#ccourses](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23ccourses) hashtag. Today I noticed a tweet from DML Research Hub “[Channelling Engelbart: Augmenting Human Education](http://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/channeling-engelbart-augmenting-human-education)” in which Howard Rheingold interviews Gardner Campbell — also tagged [#ccourses](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23ccourses). Digging a little deeper I find that #ccourses refers to the [Connected Courses course](http://connectedcourses.net/) and realised that it’s another connected MOOC-like thing facilitated by some of the [usual suspects](http://connectedcourses.net/about/people/). It’s been running two weeks already.

But, hey! It’s never to late to dive into a cMOOC.

Like many open courses of this nature, you join by registering a your blog. (Indeed some of the facilitators might insist on you having first registered a [domain of your own](http://umw.domains/) first). There has to be a post to make that registration valid. And this is that post.

As to properly engaging … I’ve got a little orientation and catching up to do first.
